19	1	the movie's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries . 				
20	1	offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication . 				
21	1	a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film . 				
22	1	with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives .

25	1	scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism . 				
26	1	occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective . 				
27	1	spiderman rocks				
28	1	an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone . 				
29	1	at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story . however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts .

34	1	if there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it's in projects like the ( unfortunately r-rated ) paid . 				
35	1	while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy . 				
36	1	though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static . 				
37	1	cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent's days				
38	1	ms . fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn . 				
39	1	though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them . 				
40	1	like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series . 				
41	1	newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg .

50	1	may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today . 				
51	1	an engaging overview of johnson's eccentric career . 				
52	1	in its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works . 				
53	1	some actors have so much charisma that you'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book . hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors .

56	1	everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse . 				
57	1	manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas . 				
58	1	singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs ? a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story ? but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece . 				
59	1	you'd think by now america would have had enough of plucky british eccentrics with hearts of gold . yet the act is still charming here .

61	1	a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors . 				
62	1	this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998's whatever . 				
63	1	disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids' books to the screen . . . tuck everlasting is a little of both .

79	1	haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration . 				
80	1	absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way . 				
81	1	it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured . 				
82	1	painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances .

84	1	an imaginative comedy/thriller . 				
85	1	a few artsy flourishes aside , narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days .

88	1	director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth . 				
89	1	the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes . 				
90	1	a sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it . 				
91	1	doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere . 				
92	1	the tenderness of the piece is still intact . 				
93	1	katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself				
94	1	like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated . 				
95	1	while mcfarlane's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films . . . it's also so jarring that it's hard to get back into the boys' story . 				
96	1	if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror . 				
97	1	in a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel . but in imax 3-d , the clich�s disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography . 				
98	1	writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear . 				
99	1	 . . . a roller-coaster ride of a movie

102	1	steve irwin's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume . 				
103	1	a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters . 				
104	1	on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique . 				
105	1	the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure . 				
106	1	if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that . 				
107	1	a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe . 				
108	1	4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip . 				
109	1	the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm	1	"I used to watch this on either HBO or Showtime or Cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90's that my parents subscribed to those channels. I came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark, bizarre and fascinating. I was young then, in my early teens; and now years later after having discovered the great Arliss Howard and being blown away by \""Big Bad Love\"" I bought the DVD of \""Wilder Napalm\"" and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years. I absolutely loved it! I was really impressed and affected by it. There are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography; all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent, intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads, their story, the music and all the other actors as well. It's truly \""Cinematic\"". I love Arliss Howard's subtle intensity, ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence, I'm a big fan of anything he does; and his interplay with Debra Winger's manic glee (they are of course married) has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera. (I wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversaries?.......\""Big Bad Love\"" should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it; it's brilliant.) And, Dennis Quaid in full clown make-up, sneakily introduced, angled, hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark book magic you don't see very often. Quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways, with that huge slit mouth span, hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness (here as both). Both Howard and Quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square-offs in darkly cool fashion. In fact the whole book has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity. It's really a fantastic book, put together by intelligence, imagination, agility and chemistry by all parties involved. I really cannot imagine how this got funded, and it looks pretty expensive to me, by such a conventional, imagination-less system, but I thank God books like this slip through the system every once in awhile. In a great way, with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors, hip intelligence, darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite books of all time: \""Grosse Pointe Blank\"".......now that's a compliment in my book!"		
110	1	it might be tempting to regard mr . andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr . earnhart's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists . 				
111	1	a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term . 				
112	1	edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery . 				
113	1	a mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser . 				
114	1	it's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self . 				
115	1	hip-hop has a history , and it's a metaphor for this love story . 				
116	1	in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level . 				
117	1	this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there .

119	1	a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing . 				
120	1	somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 				
121	1	digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world . 				
122	1	unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity . 				
123	1	an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to . 				
124	1	" "" extreme ops "" exceeds expectations . good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography . "				
125	1	you should pay nine bucks for this : because you can hear about suffering afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected . dramas like this make it human . 				
126	1	a thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action . still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences . 				
127	1	it's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world .

134	1	[schweiger is] talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists .

137	1	it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days . 				
138	1	gloriously goofy ( and gory ) midnight movie stuff . 				
139	1	the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity . 				
140	1	if your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket . 				
141	1	it's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene . 				
142	1	it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times . 				
143	1	as lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten . 				
144	1	like mike doesn't win any points for originality . it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism . 				
145	1	it's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech . 				
146	1	far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place . . . innocent and well-meaning . 				
147	1	a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life . 				
148	1	waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality . 				
149	1	tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy . 				
150	1	more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent . 				
151	1	enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd . 				
152	1	here's a british flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you . 				
153	1	it's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh . 				
154	1	must be seen to be believed . 				
155	1	ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but don't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here .

158	1	the year's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way . 				
159	1	fans of behan's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy . 				
160	1	its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it's too slowly paced to be a thriller . [but it's] worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser . 				
161	1	the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are . 				
162	1	stephen earnhart's homespun documentary mule skinner blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens . 				
163	1	a solidly seaworthy chiller .

167	1	there's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable . 				
168	1	remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster . . . done up by howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand . 				
169	1	makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran's borderlands .

175	1	ranks among willams' best screen work . 				
176	1	engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship . 				
177	1	an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment . 				
178	1	it's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit . 				
179	1	thoroughly enjoyable . 				
180	1	maybe it's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades . . . but honestly , analyze that really isn't all that bad .

204	1	it is interesting and fun to see goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen . 				
205	1	it won't bust your gut -- and it's not intended to -- it's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke . 				
206	1	a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race .

216	1	tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point . 				
217	1	purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s . foreign policy has played in the rise of castro . 				
218	1	now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism . 				
219	1	we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood couldn't possibly fictionalize and be believed . 				
220	1	though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 				
221	1	daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget . 				
222	1	the dangerous lives of altar boys' take on adolescence feels painfully true . 				
223	1	moore's performance impresses almost as much as her work with haynes in 1995's safe . 				
224	1	visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last . 				
225	1	an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true . 				
226	1	mr . parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom . 				
227	1	the result is something quite fresh and delightful . 				
228	1	all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure . 				
229	1	despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is amy's self-absorbed personality -- amy's o's honesty will win you over . 				
230	1	this is one of polanski's best films . 				
231	1	day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs . 				
232	1	polished korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as hollywood action epics . is this progress ? 				
233	1	elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone . 				
234	1	denis and co-writer michele petin's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing . lead provocatuers testud and parmentier give superlative performances				
235	1	an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood . 				
236	1	i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending . 				
237	1	the passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air . 				
238	1	remarkably accessible and affecting . 				
239	1	never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive . 				
240	1	a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction ! 				
241	1	behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art . 				
242	1	jir� hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . . 				
243	1	moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out . 				
244	1	the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff . 				
245	1	though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium .

247	1	provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of todd solondz .

252	1	one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .

254	1	benefits from a strong performance from zhao , but it's dong jie's face you remember at the end . 				
255	1	this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever . 				
256	1	the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun . 				
257	1	it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes .

265	1	by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so . 				
266	1	an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video . 				
267	1	an incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar ( and peculiarly venomous ) bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy				
268	1	all the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , all or nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit . 				
269	1	" "" its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right . "" "				
270	1	it's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be . 	1	Domestic Import was a great book. I laughed the whole time. It was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations. The acting was great. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman, and all the others did an awesome job. Because it is an independent book written by a first-time writer, it doesn't have the clichés that are expected of other comedies, which was such a relief. It was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart-warming story. I heard it was based on a true story? If so, then that is hilarious (and amazing!). I highly recommend this book.		
271	1	this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first . 				
272	1	parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness . 				
273	1	m�nch's genuine insight makes the film's occasional overindulgence forgivable . 				
274	1	thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality . . . takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda . 				
275	1	ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis . 				
276	1	if you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite . 				
277	1	the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime . 				
278	1	there are a few stabs at absurdist comedy . . . but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an iranian specialty . 				
279	1	a wonderful character-based comedy . 				
280	1	it would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in talk to her , the women are down for the count . 				
281	1	an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick . 				
282	1	the unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right . 				
283	1	it uses an old-time formula , it's not terribly original and it's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie my big fat greek wedding . 	0	Bad plot, bad dialogue, bad acting, idiotic directing, the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script, and a crappy copy of the VHS cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor. Trust me, because I stuck this turkey out to the end. It was so pathetically bad all over that I had to figure it was a fourth-rate spoof of Springtime for Hitler.<br /><br />The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only faint spark of interest, and that was only because she could sing better than the original.<br /><br />If you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better, then watch Beyond The Valley of The Dolls.		
284	1	it's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia . 				
285	1	who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images don't have to add up to mesmerize you . 				
286	1	the tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable . 				
287	1	the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts . 				
288	1	it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment . 				
289	1	what's most striking about this largely celebratory film . . . is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world . 				
290	1	 . . . if you're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the troopers will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games . 				
291	1	somewhat blurred , but kinnear's performance is razor sharp . 				
292	1	as a director , mr . ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects . 				
293	1	for anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man's response to stroke , ram dass : fierce grace is worth seeking out . 				
294	1	intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed . 				
295	1	the new guy does have a heart . now , if it only had a brain . 				
296	1	a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america's culture of fear . 				
297	1	legendary irish writer brendan behan's memoir , borstal boy , has been given a loving screen transferral . 				
298	1	the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture . 				
299	1	this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences . 	0	Six different couples. Six different love stories. Six different love angles. Eighty numbers of audience in the book theater. Looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen.<br /><br />I am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the book. All stories have got no link with each other, but somewhere down the line Nikhil Advani trying to show some relation between them. I tried to find out a few lines I could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write. The book is a poor copy of Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTUALLY.<br /><br />My suggestion. Don't watch the book if you really want to watch a nice book.		
300	1	it's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .

303	1	i don't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh's full frontal , though that didn't stop me from enjoying much of it . 				
304	1	the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology . 				
305	1	nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme . 				
306	1	you could say that it's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't , but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable . 				
307	1	asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy . 				
308	1	roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck ? few filmmakers will . but based on cq , i'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project .

310	1	high on melodrama . but it's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast . 				
311	1	finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less . 				
312	1	it's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world . 				
313	1	spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects . he just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality . here , thankfully , they are . 				
314	1	"post 9/11 the philosophical message of "" personal freedom first "" might not be as palatable as intended . "				
315	1	hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love . 				
316	1	this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .

321	1	clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie . 				
322	1	 . . . always remains movingly genuine . 	0	This guy has no idea of cinema. Okay, it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth, and about two acceptable books that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship. This all is very good, but look carefully: HE DOES NOT KNOW HIS JOB! The scenes are unbalanced, without proper start and and, with a disordered content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say about the subject, so he over-licitates with violence, nakedness and gutter language. How is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art? Why don't they let him succumb in piece?

327	1	an involving true story of a chinese actor who takes up drugs and winds up in an institution--acted mostly by the actual people involved . 				
328	1	hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship . 				
329	1	it's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart . 				
330	1	this is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story's a little weak . 				
331	1	compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady . 				
332	1	it's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the marks family . 				
333	1	a whole lot foul , freaky and funny . 				
334	1	family fare . 				
335	1	attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage . 				
336	1	the diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time . 				
337	1	the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain . 				
338	1	foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling . 				
339	1	"even if you can't pronounce "" gyro "" correctly , you'll appreciate much of vardalos' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries . "				
340	1	is office work really as alienating as 'bartleby' so effectively makes it ? 				
341	1	farrell . . . thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis's world-weary colonel . 				
342	1	audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film's tart , sugar-free wit . 				
343	1	bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake . 				
344	1	an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson . 				
345	1	as expected , sayles' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances . 				
346	1	a model of what films like this should be like . 				
347	1	as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create . 				
348	1	yeah , these flicks are just that damn good . isn't it great ? 				
349	1	an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection . 				
350	1	over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance .

365	1	it's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more . 				
366	1	while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there's much truth and no small amount of poetry in girls can't swim .

375	1	longley has constructed a remarkably coherent , horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days . 				
376	1	although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious . 				
377	1	often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie . 				
378	1	go see it and enjoy . 				
379	1	the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension . 				
380	1	george clooney proves he's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind . 				
381	1	there's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking . 				
382	1	murderous maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth . 				
383	1	the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next .

390	1	[anderson] uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense . 				
391	1	bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that doesn't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it . 				
392	1	"despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams "" bathroom break ! "" "

399	1	kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed . 				
400	1	chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws . 				
401	1	its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 				
402	1	it represents better-than-average movie-making that doesn't demand a dumb , distracted audience .

410	1	starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end . it's still worth a look . 				
411	1	most impressive , though , is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds . 				
412	1	a hip ride into hyper-time , clockstoppers is a lively and enjoyable adventure for all ages at any time . 				
413	1	grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 				
414	1	 . . . a polished and relatively sincere piece of escapism . 				
415	1	the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that's rare in film today , but be warned : it's a slow slog to get there . 				
416	1	the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by . 				
417	1	" . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its "" men in a sardine can "" warped logic . "				
418	1	long after you leave justine , you'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean . 				
419	1	still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at 'face value' to recommend to anyone looking for something different .

423	1	the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 				
424	1	a splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience . 				
425	1	disney's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem .

427	1	whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion . 				
428	1	there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year . unfortunately , they're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo's life imaginable . 				
429	1	there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected ( and gentle ) way . 				
430	1	"stay clear of reminding yourself that it's a "" true story "" and you're likely to have one helluva time at the movies . "				
431	1	there are just enough twists in the tale to make it far more satisfying than almost any horror film in recent memory . 				
432	1	the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing . 				
433	1	working from elliott's memoir , rohmer fashions the sort of delicate , articulate character- and- relationship study he's favored for decades . 				
434	1	the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue . 				
435	1	when it really counts . . . bloody sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language . 				
436	1	the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us . 				
437	1	[an] hilarious romantic comedy . 				
438	1	the actors are fantastic . they are what makes it worth the trip to the theatre . 				
439	1	ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum . 				
440	1	i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible . 				
441	1	recalls quiet freak-outs like l'avventura and repulsion .

444	1	a great comedy filmmaker knows great comedy needn't always make us laugh . tim story's not there yet - but 'barbershop' shows he's on his way . 				
445	1	the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon . 				
446	1	lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie . 				
447	1	well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull . 				
448	1	jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot . 				
449	1	[taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work . this isn't a new idea . it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion . 				
450	1	an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent .

455	1	one of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you didn't know was being taken . 				
456	1	not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters . 				
457	1	as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness . her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant . 				
458	1	[villeneuve] seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death . 				
459	1	the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor . 				
460	1	fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life .

463	1	what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved . 				
464	1	an exhilarating experience . 				
465	1	this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap . 				
466	1	the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor .

468	1	a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan's heroes star bob crane . 				
469	1	the film delivers not just the full assault of reno's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days . 				
470	1	what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity . 				
471	1	sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna doesn't suck as an actress . 				
472	1	although very much like the first movie based on j . k . rowling's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude .

474	1	as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing . 				
475	1	maguire is a surprisingly effective peter/spider-man .

484	1	this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy .

486	1	never [sinks] into exploitation . 				
487	1	an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale . 				
488	1	there's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film . . . or the emotional integrity of the performances . 				
489	1	few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness . 				
490	1	exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven? [the film] addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce . 				
491	1	stevenson's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination . 				
492	1	this is a very fine movie -- go see it . 				
493	1	as shaky as the plot is , kaufman's script is still memorable for some great one-liners . 				
494	1	despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions .

496	1	not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies . 				
497	1	a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido . 				
498	1	a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that isn't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears . 				
499	1	the film's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard . . . 				
500	1	does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively . 				
501	1	almost every scene in this film is a gem that could stand alone , a perfectly realized observation of mood , behavior and intent . 				
502	1	a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 				
503	1	you won't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all . 				
504	1	this version's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful . 				
505	1	the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups . 				
506	1	provide[s] nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue . 				
507	1	if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right . 				
508	1	too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience . 				
509	1	the saturation bombing of reggio's images and glass' evocative music . . . ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning .

511	1	"a depressing confirmation of everything those of us who don't object to the description "" unelected "" have suspected all along : george w . bush is an incurious , uncharismatic , overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide . "				
512	1	this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride . 				
513	1	sure , it's more of the same , but as the film proves , that's not always a bad thing . 				
514	1	a lighthearted , feel-good film that embraces the time-honored truth that the most powerful thing in life is love . 				
515	1	a bowel-curdling , heart-stopping recipe for terror . 				
516	1	daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who aren't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war . 				
517	1	zhang yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones . 				
518	1	 . . . breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters . 				
519	1	' . . . both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '				
520	1	a pleasant romantic comedy . 				
521	1	it's a count for our times . 				
522	1	greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill				
523	1	smith's point is simple and obvious -- people's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers . 				
524	1	a romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions . 				
525	1	vividly conveys both the pitfalls and the pleasures of over-the-top love . 				
526	1	 . . . a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway . 				
527	1	a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances . 				
528	1	for the first two-thirds of this sparklingly inventive and artful , always fast and furious tale , kids will go happily along for the ride . 				
529	1	majidi's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times . 				
530	1	the smartest bonehead comedy of the summer . 				
531	1	effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience . 				
532	1	i love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off . 				
533	1	in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work . 				
534	1	only two words will tell you what you know when deciding to see it : anthony . hopkins . 				
535	1	the movie's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow . 				
536	1	a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation . 				
537	1	hayek is stunning as frida and . . . a star-making project . 				
538	1	it's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary . . . 				
539	1	hilarious , acidic brit comedy . 				
540	1	as a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it doesn't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions . 				
541	1	an ironic speculation on democracy in a culture unaccustomed to it . 				
542	1	it's not life-affirming ? its vulgar and mean , but i liked it . 				
543	1	several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare . 				
544	1	the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth . 				
545	1	led by griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material . 				
546	1	tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth . 				
547	1	a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills . 				
548	1	a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last . 				
549	1	possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it's directed by . . . neil labute . hmm . 				
550	1	an uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the italian masterpiece . 				
551	1	windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop . 				
552	1	having never been a huge fan of dickens' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath's version . 				
553	1	the best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates . 				
554	1	for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way . 				
555	1	this is pretty dicey material . but some unexpected zigs and zags help . 				
556	1	compellingly watchable . 				
557	1	the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers . 				
558	1	the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them . 				
559	1	you don't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor's club . 				
560	1	this romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime england , and ably captures the speech patterns , moral codes and ideals of the 1940s . 				
561	1	divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances . 				
562	1	viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson's novel will likely prefer disney's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic . 				
563	1	a journey through memory , a celebration of living , and a sobering rumination on fatality , classism , and ignorance . 				
564	1	resourceful and ingenious entertainment . 				
565	1	" "" antwone fisher "" is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington . it won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking . "				
566	1	a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail . 				
567	1	we need [moore's] noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones . 				
568	1	although the editing might have been tighter , hush ! sympathetically captures the often futile lifestyle of young people in modern japan . 				
569	1	[gai] comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form . 				
570	1	these are lives worth watching , paths worth following . 				
571	1	it's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable . 				
572	1	a moody horror/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director's well-known narrative gamesmanship . 				
573	1	as a singular character study , it's perfect . it's also the year's sweetest movie . 				
574	1	a graceful , contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined . 				
575	1	"while not as aggressively impressive as its american counterpart , "" in the bedroom , "" moretti's film makes its own , quieter observations"				
576	1	the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting . 				
577	1	time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets				
578	1	" "" the emperor's new clothes "" begins with a simple plan . . . . well , at least that's the plan . "	1	This is, in my opinion, much better than either of the 2 1990's versions, but is still not all that good. It feels dated, probably because it is, but it does stand up well compared to other BBC 1980's period pieces such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey.<br /><br />The length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90's versions, and St John Rivers is at least covered, although not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but the actress playing Jane is much too old. There is definitely scope for a TV adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it.		
579	1	haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed . 				
580	1	[director peter] jackson and his crew have so steeped themselves in the majesty of tolkien's writing that every frame produces new joys , whether you're a fan of the books or not . 				
581	1	while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale . 				
582	1	the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . 				
583	1	an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world . 				
584	1	an offbeat , sometimes gross and surprisingly appealing animated film about the true meaning of the holidays . 				
585	1	this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire . 				
586	1	sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling . and in this regard , on guard delivers . 				
587	1	 . . . ambition is in short supply in the cinema , and egoyan tackles his themes and explores his characters' crises with seriousness and compassion . 				
588	1	an impossible romance , but we root for the patronized iranian lad . 				
589	1	like dickens with his passages , mcgrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel . 				
590	1	there's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible . 				
591	1	an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great ?what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances				
592	1	a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive . 				
593	1	a quietly reflective and melancholy new zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl's life . 				
594	1	cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone . 				
595	1	very solid , very watchable first feature for director peter sheridan				
596	1	a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives . 				
597	1	it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media . . . to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks . 				
598	1	workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies . 				
599	1	a pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place . 				
600	1	branagh , in his most forceful non-shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit . 				
601	1	though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes . 				
602	1	compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder . 				
603	1	what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness . 				
604	1	the warm presence of zhao benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be . 				
605	1	this is as powerful a set of evidence as you'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives . 				
606	1	director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one . 				
607	1	skip work to see it at the first opportunity . 				
608	1	bow's best moments are when he's getting busy on the basketball court because that's when he really scores . 				
609	1	offers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude . 				
610	1	in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did . sometimes , that's enough . 				
611	1	an intimate , good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected . 				
612	1	ice cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance . . . 				
613	1	both deeply weird and charmingly dear . 				
614	1	as blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , el bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance . 				
615	1	despite a story predictable enough to make the sound of music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it . 				
616	1	it's a masterpiece . 				
617	1	an incredibly low-rent danish film , it brings a group of people together in a sweet and charming way , if a little convenient				
618	1	it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep . 				
619	1	director nalin pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other . he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works . no question . 				
620	1	"what "" empire "" lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart . "				
621	1	claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications . 				
622	1	what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment . still , i'm not quite sure what the point is?				
623	1	rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual . 				
624	1	 ( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning . . . ( but ) lohman's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer . . . 				
625	1	do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman doesn't work ? 				
626	1	ford deserves to be remembered at oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier . 				
627	1	the film's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen . 				
628	1	don't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches . . . 				
629	1	"as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys' novel "" the death of napoleon "" and directed by alan taylor , napoleon's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn"	0	In my humble opinion, this version of the great BDWY musical has only two things going for it - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a booked version with the original script. (OK Vanessa Williams is good to watch.)But to me that's all there is. Most of the cast seem to be walking through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is and no wonder people walk over Harry McAfee when it's played by George Wendt who looks like he'd rather be back on a bar stool in Boston. Jason Alexander is passable, but that wig has to go and I saw better dancing in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it's good to have a version of the stage script now, but I hope the young out there, who have never seen a musical, DON'T judge them all by this.		
630	1	the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn't go too much further . 				
631	1	this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics . 				
632	1	a yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it . 				
633	1	this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable . 				
634	1	complex , affecting and uniquely almod�var , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong . 				
635	1	good ol' urban legend stuff . 				
636	1	not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen . this isn't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend . 				
637	1	it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood . 				
638	1	it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . 				
639	1	on its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist byatt . 				
640	1	light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time . 				
641	1	pray's film works well and will appeal even to those who aren't too familiar with turntablism . 				
642	1	troubling and powerful . 				
643	1	good movie . good actress . but if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked . 				
644	1	it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion . it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise . 				
645	1	with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast . 				
646	1	it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal .

What more could you ask for? For laughs, it just doesn't get any better than this. Zadora's over-acting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the \""Hollywood\"" machine. Almost as funny as \""Spinal Tap\"" even though it was clearly not intended as such. Don't miss Ray Liotta's debut book line, \""Looks like a penis.\""
""1925_9"	1	This has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment. It takes the sugary-sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats, brat brothers, over-protective fathers and bimbo sisters. I'm almost surprised it's Disney!<br /><br />To its credit, '8 Simple Rules' knows it's a comedy and doesn't try to be more. Too many shows (eg, 'Sister, Sister' and 'Lizzie McGuire') think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard-hitting. This is a trap '8 Simple Rules' has avoided; it does tackle some issues (such as being the school outcast) but it has fun while doing so. In fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of John Ritter and his character.<br /><br />And I think, although John Ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark, '8 Simple Rules' can still do well if it remembers its humour and doesn't make Cate's father a second version of Paul Hennessy.

706	1	an incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams . 				
707	1	there's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm . 				
708	1	as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining . 	0	"Kenneth Branagh attempts to turn William Shakspeare's obscure, rarely-produced comedy into a 1930s-era musical, with the result being both bad Shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane, who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as Costard but is badly mistaken, and Alicia Silverstone who handles the Shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenaged Valley Girl who is reading the script aloud in her middle school English class.<br /><br />The musical numbers are staged with the expertise of a high school production of \""Dames at Sea,\"" leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing, with the lone exception being Adrian Lester who proves himself a splendid song and dance man. The only other saving grace of the book are Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer's contribution as eye candy, but they have given far better performances than in this book and you'd be wise to check out some of the other titles in their bookographies and gives this witless mess a pass."		
709	1	even if the ride's a little bumpy , with a final lap that's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director roger michell , best known for the superfluous notting hill , credit for trying . 				
710	1	not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care .

739	1	the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece . 				
740	1	 . . . an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs . 				
741	1	it's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds . 				
742	1	offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works . 				
743	1	i don't think i've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto's iron man .

745	1	director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini's famous love-jealousy- murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation . 				
746	1	lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth . 				
747	1	frida's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it's among the most breathtakingly designed films i've ever seen . 				
748	1	the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide .

753	1	sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film .

756	1	a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania . 				
757	1	the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom . 				
758	1	occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao . 				
759	1	bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he can't help throwing in a few of his own touches . 				
760	1	the 3d images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen .

Masterpiece's review had me in tears, that's so funny. Anyway, this book is the among the worst books ever, and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels. The \""Omen\"" name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on HBO, but it's a slap in the face to the other three, especially the original. There are so many classically bad moments, but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair!! good times ! This book is to the Omen series what \""Scary book\"" is to the entire genre. Avoid unless you're looking for a good laugh."

Soha Ali and Abhay Deol both look very beautiful. Soha reminds you so much of her mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming future.<br /><br />The ending of the book is very different from most books. In a way you are left unsatisfied but if you really think about it in real terms, you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the book. Otherwise, it would have been gross injustice to everyone. <br /><br />The book is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in court. Her boyfriend does not show up and she ends up being helped by the witness. Slowly slowly, over the time, he falls in love for her. It is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not. Watch the book for complete details. <br /><br />The book really belongs to Abhay. I look forward to seeing more books from him. Soha is pretty but did not speak much in the book. Her eyes, her innocence did most of the talking.

992	1	the movie isn't always easy to look at . but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here . 	0	I confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts books, and while I sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedies, they really need to be crazy to be funny. 'Over Her Dead Body' seems to take afterlife a little bit too seriously, and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect I can think about. The story is completely unbelievable of course, and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register. The choice of the principal actresses was awful. While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy, the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as Eva Longoria seems too aged (sorry) for him, and Lake Bell seems too unattractive (sorry again). A romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles. The rest is uninteresting and uninspired, with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful TV comedies. Nothing really worth watching, nothing to remember.

The morale of the book shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end. One of the tigers in the group got an order to finally capture the baby, who was hardly saved by his mother when the tigers attacked her community. The baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth, but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby. They went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger, and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth. At the end the group of tigers tried to capture the baby but the mammoth helped incredibly by his tiger colleague was able to overcome this attack and to give the baby back to his father and the community to which he belongs.

That is the problem isn't? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance. It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters. This book doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. First you don't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are not believable in the way they act and interact. Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum, frowning and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here. I mean what is that?, he looks like he's on the toilet or something. I loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. But not for this, he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner, it's not natural, I'm surprised he didn't dislocate his jaw during booking. The book is basically on life support, it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come.

The shortcomings of the book's limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than compensated for by the visual poetry of the story of young Brendan's heroic quest to become a master illuminator during the dark ages. Historically this was in the late 8th century, when the centers of Irish learning were over-run by the Vikings. The Vikings appear here as brute antagonists, the equivalent on the North Seas of the plundering Huns and Mongols further East. The book's narrative--- which functions more as a parable--- centers around the conflict between Brendan, who seeks to create beauty in his illuminations during a time of encroaching darkness, and his stern Uncle the Abbot-- who seeks to protect the town of Kells and his nephew with a looming wall as barrier against the Norsemen. The Abbot disregards the value of Brendan's art in his quest for security. This is the book's outer conflict. Brendan's inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative illumination which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the Book of Kells. This eye is guarded by a Dragon Ouroboros, who destroys from within those not suited to this quest as surely as the Vikings will kill from without (That's as much of the story as I'll divulge!)<br /><br />What I really like about this book is its creators' imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the West from 1200 years ago. The characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original Book of Kells. (Particularly noteworthy is monk Aidan's pet cat, defined in few lines, yet purely--- and even magically metamorphically feline.) The range of emotion which Brendan and the other animated characters convey given their economy of abstract design is a tribute to the excellent artistry of the director and his animators. The decorative borders on the edge of the picture change to complement the dramatic impact of a given scene, and this characteristic of illuminations from the dark ages is brought to wondrous animated life in THE SECRET OF KELLS. Of course, historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor to depict. However, by introducing archetypal elements into this story, the writers and director of THE SECRET OF KELLS convey a numinous sense of lived-life from that far-off time in Ireland which feels psychologically true, however much the script might stray from pedantic historical fact. (The United Nations' band of illuminators who appear as a rogues' club of artists in The SECRET OF KELLS aren't historically probable, but they're all well-designed, individuated characters who do much to convey the universal appeal of this quintessentially Irish story.) Animation has always seemed the best vehicle to me to better help us understand the visual art of different times and cultures. The magnificent art direction of this book clearly derives from its historical visual source, but has also been cleverly adapted to the demands of animated storytelling; if animation had existed in the Dark Ages, the SECRET OF KELLS is what it would look like! Finally, Brendan's hero's quest in this book is the artist's perennial quest to convey the spirit of beauty, life and inspiration. (Without being preachy or even particularly Christian, this book affirms Jesus' dictum that \""Man does not live by bread alone.\"" ) In my estimation the most inspired book about the creative process of visual artists is Andrei Tarkovsky's ANDREI RUBLEV, a book about the great Russian icon painter of the 15th century. The SECRET OF KELLS expresses much the same sense of mystery and exhilaration about the artist's visual quest and creative process. It's certainly not as profound as ANDREI RUBLEV, but--- heck--- its a cartoon! (And one which will appeal to young and old alike.) I think this book will hold up well to repeated viewing: in its own modest life-affirming way, this stylized SECRET OF KELLS is a classic."

1251	1	it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland . 				
1252	1	[chaiken's] talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters .

1260	1	the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties . 				
1261	1	travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment . 				
1262	1	polished , well-structured film . 				
1263	1	there's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like steven spielberg to follow a . i . with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority .

1273	1	it's unnerving to see recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment . good film , but very glum . 				
1274	1	much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation . 				
1275	1	dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then there's the music . . . 				
1276	1	it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience .

1315	1	the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture , the l . a . beach scene and the imaginative ( and sometimes illegal ) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults . 				
1316	1	even if you don't think [kissinger's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch . 				
1317	1	the story and structure are well-honed . fresnadillo's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that won't go away . 				
1318	1	it's made with deftly unsettling genre flair . 				
1319	1	it just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read stevenson's book , which is a treasure in and of itself .

1323	1	ramsay , as in ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid . 				
1324	1	it may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert . 				
1325	1	a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures .

1332	1	there is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them . 				
1333	1	cq's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors . 				
1334	1	it's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it . 				
1335	1	for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece . 				
1336	1	the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro . . . couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment . 				
1337	1	this in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come . 				
1338	1	it shows us a slice of life that's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable . 				
1339	1	a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture .

1346	1	see it . debate it . remember it . 				
1347	1	try as you might to resist , if you've got a place in your heart for smokey robinson , this movie will worm its way there .

1349	1	director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading . 				
1350	1	stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 . 				
1351	1	i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 				
1352	1	with not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis . 				
1353	1	it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics . 				
1354	1	slow and ponderous , but rohmer's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption . 				
1355	1	if you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force . 				
1356	1	austin powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later . 				
1357	1	while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in . 				
1358	1	cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio . 				
1359	1	elvira fans could hardly ask for more . 				
1360	1	a canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists . 				
1361	1	the movie should be credited with remembering his victims . 				
1362	1	fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough . 				
1363	1	a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale . 				
1364	1	hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation . 				
1365	1	as if trying to grab a lump of play-doh , the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story , the more details slip out between his fingers . 				
1366	1	my big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year , it's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss . 				
1367	1	few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying . 				
1368	1	another love story in 2002's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre . 				
1369	1	it's another retelling of alexandre dumas' classic . why ? who knows , but it works under the direction of kevin reynolds . 				
1370	1	[f]rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . 				
1371	1	shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience . 				
1372	1	provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already . 				
1373	1	a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination . 				
1374	1	this isn't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work . 				
1375	1	overall , it's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : god is love . 				
1376	1	it may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case . 				
1377	1	although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 				
1378	1	jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying . 				
1379	1	the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all can't stand . 				
1380	1	george clooney , in his first directorial effort , presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years . 				
1381	1	even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking				
1382	1	although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale . 				
1383	1	a life-size reenactment of those jack chick cartoon tracts that always ended with some hippie getting tossed into the lake of fire . 				
1384	1	grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors . 				
1385	1	this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered . 				
1386	1	the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer . 				
1387	1	daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails . 				
1388	1	 . . . in no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy , it doesn't disappoint . 				
1389	1	clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , slap her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up . 				
1390	1	cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression . 				
1391	1	sex is one of those films that aims to confuse . 				
1392	1	compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen , runteldat is something of a triumph . 				
1393	1	[moore's] better at fingering problems than finding solutions . but though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more . 				
1394	1	the powerful success of read my lips with such provocative material shows why , after only three films , director/co-writer jacques audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers . 	0	"If there was some weird inversed Oscar Academy awards festival this flick would win it all. It has all the gods, excellent plot, extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar. Well, this could be the scenario if the world was inversed, but it's not. Instead it's the worst horror flick ever made, not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia, but also extremely low on special effects. For example the devil costume (which by the way is a must-see), is something of the most hilarious I've ever seen. Whenever I saw that red-black so called monster on screen I couldn't hold my laugh back. And to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyor-belt.<br /><br />Do not do the same mistake as I did. Checking IMDB seeing that the book was released in 2003, had less than five votes and thinking: -\""Well, it's worth a shot, can't be that bad\"".<br /><br />Yes it could.<br /><br />I'm not even going to waste more words on this book."

The show is horrible. I understand it, and that's another horrible thing about it. The only cool character there EVER was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode, but then I see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible. It's not funny, NOT funny! I don't want people to say \""Only smart people get it\"" because if they're so smart why do they judge people they don't even know and say that they're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying \""The sky is red\"" but never looking outside. But anyways, this is absolutely the worst show I have ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they're just horrible, her controversy is very lame, her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting. I'm not sure what these \""smart\"" people see in this show, but judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment."

You should not see this book but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here, there are SPOILERS. Gray Matters centers on Gray and Sam Baldwin (Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh). Only Gray and Sam are Brother and Sister; living together in everyone else's eyes as man and wife. No sex but just about everything else. Early on, the book starts with its theme: 'the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions'. Gray and Sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch. Rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him, she does it and gets to the nitty-gritty questions too. When she signals her brother to come over they start a 3-way date. Charlie (Bridget Moynahan) is the girl of THEIR dreams, like all the right things etc Sam final hits Gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal! That Charlie accepts! In one week Charlie, Gray and Sam are to be in Vegas. In the next week Charlie and Gray are off shopping for wedding gowns (apparently Charlie has an off-the-rack figure). Gray is slurping an iced latte when Charlie suggests Gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a $10,000 frock for her. While Charlie is zipping her in this 'down-payment-on-a-house' gown Gray continues to slurp on the latte (I swear it was like a feed bag). What should happen but 'woops!' latte all over the gown. It is never explained how they got out of Bloomingdale's bridal salon with out a $10,000 mocha colored gown. Back to 'reality'  Caesar's palace Las Vegas. They have the 'high roller room' (Sam is a resident surgeon and Charlie is an intern zoologist  were do they get all this money?) Gray kicks Sam out to the single room down the hall so she and Charlie can have a bachelorette drink-a-thon were, you guessed it - they kiss. Gray remembers everything; Charlie remembers nada. They make it to wedding chapel and right when the Reverend gets to his line \""If there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds\"" Gray gets the hiccups. Gray excuses herself, for some reason the Reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again 'hiccups'. Gray gets back to NY and starts dating any man she meets, literally. And of course one is you guessed it again! Gay. The other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver (Alan Cummings) named Gordy. He is smittened with Gray but the feelings are not returned. They become great friends. This is good because when she comes clean with Sam about the kiss. He blows up and kicks her out of their apartment. When Sam comes to his senses he goes to her office. Gray works at an ad agency. This office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone. It has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency. Sam gets Gray in one of the conference rooms for a not-so-private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office. This is where I doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew: Gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar. 'Sorry no men' says the bouncer. So Gray and Gordy return with Gordy in drag. Bad drag. He was in a sleeveless black satin-like blouse, a string of pearls, and a grandma's church hat. No lesbian would ever confuse this 'man in a dress' as a drag queen much less a woman. The bar was also the straight man's fantasy of what a lesbian bar is: full of Victoria's Secret models. Everything turns out peachy  she goes home with her firm's client. Gray happens to be on the woman's account and finally does more then kiss. For some reason no one tells Charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole book of this kiss with Gray, but that is for the sequel."

1452	1	goes a long way on hedonistic gusto . 				
1453	1	the result puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally couldn't care less . 				
1454	1	the scorpion king is more fun than conan the barbarian .

1469	1	"when it's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama , "" real women have curves "" is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams . "				
1470	1	the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters -- but it's smooth and professional . 				
1471	1	blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological . 				
1472	1	this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year ! 				
1473	1	triumph of love is a very silly movie , but the silliness has a pedigree . 				
1474	1	discursive but oddly riveting documentary . 				
1475	1	the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people .

1500	1	may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman .

1504	1	it's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 . 				
1505	1	it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 				
1506	1	you can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , 'this is going to be something really good . ' and it is .

1511	1	though the story . . . is hackneyed , the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament . 				
1512	1	although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work . 				
1513	1	if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 				
1514	1	the climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does				
1515	1	a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children's television . 				
1516	1	all comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad . 				
1517	1	if a horror movie's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well . . . a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride . 				
1518	1	a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences . 				
1519	1	brilliantly written and well-acted , yellow asphalt is an uncompromising film . 				
1520	1	that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 				
1521	1	personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us .

1524	1	a dashing and absorbing outing with one of france's most inventive directors . 				
1525	1	it's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 				
1526	1	 . . . flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 				
1527	1	the trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking ? because you get it . 				
1528	1	nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you . he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty . 				
1529	1	what it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart . 				
1530	1	robert harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows . 				
1531	1	genuinely unnerving . 				
1532	1	american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone . 				
1533	1	a compelling film . 				
1534	1	with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone				
1535	1	in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 				
1536	1	the heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death . 				
1537	1	will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 				
1538	1	its director's most substantial feature for some time . 				
1539	1	fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . 				
1540	1	the son of the bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues . this movie is to be cherished . 				
1541	1	 . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 				
1542	1	the story's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr . day-lewis roars with leonine power . 				
1543	1	p . t . anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible . 				
1544	1	twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 				
1545	1	this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . 				
1546	1	it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . 				
1547	1	this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be . 				
1548	1	even through its flaws , revolution #9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film . 				
1549	1	the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . 				
1550	1	schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms . mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation . 				
1551	1	lejos del para�so es al mismo tiempo una fiesta para los ojos y o�dos y un movilizador cuadro de personajes enfrentados a sus propios deseos , miedos y prejuicios . 				
1552	1	watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power . 				
1553	1	there is no denying the power of polanski's film . . . 				
1554	1	the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat . 				
1555	1	this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed . 				
1556	1	el t�tulo no enga�a : la pel�cula narra una historia donde una mujer enfrentar� cierta realidad , y donde el sexo es . . . 				
1557	1	offers a persuasive look at a defeated but defiant nation in flux . 				
1558	1	'interesante y disfrutable trabajo gracias a que prescinde del cl�sico elemento estadounidense patriotero y manipulador . '				
1559	1	a return to pure disney magic and is enjoyable family fare . 				
1560	1	takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze . 				
1561	1	a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart . 				
1562	1	gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways . 				
1563	1	witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy . 				
1564	1	even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it's documenting . 				
1565	1	got a david lynch jones ? then you'd do well to check this one out because it's straight up twin peaks action . . . 				
1566	1	astonishing . . . [frames] profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment . 				
1567	1	take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length . 				
1568	1	it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile . 				
1569	1	one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . 				
1570	1	rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material . 				
1571	1	an elegant and sly deadpan comedy . 				
1572	1	the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful . 				
1573	1	land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored . 				
1574	1	'blue crush' swims away with the sleeper movie of the summer award . 				
1575	1	you're not merely watching history , you're engulfed by it . 				
1576	1	a chick flick for guys . 				
1577	1	it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise . 				
1578	1	the quiet american isn't a bad film , it's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar . 				
1579	1	as home movie gone haywire , it's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i'd rather listen to old tori amos records . 				
1580	1	in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film . 				
1581	1	like an episode of mtv's undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance . . . indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper . 				
1582	1	deliciously slow . 				
1583	1	a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene's work as well as a remarkably faithful one . 				
1584	1	it's not just a feel-good movie , it's a feel movie . you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did . 				
1585	1	it's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety . 				
1586	1	what makes barbershop so likable , with all its flaws , is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies . 				
1587	1	watching these two actors play against each other so intensely , but with restraint , is a treat . 				
1588	1	an example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship . 				
1589	1	a meditation on faith and madness , frailty is blood-curdling stuff . 				
1590	1	the production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating . 				
1591	1	a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising . 				
1592	1	so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 				
1593	1	suspend your disbelief here and now , or you'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits . 				
1594	1	trades run-of-the-mill revulsion for extreme unease . 				
1595	1	 . . . one of the more influential works of the 'korean new wave' . 				
1596	1	implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most american of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all . 				
1597	1	a beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in korea . 				
1598	1	director-writer bille august . . . depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey martin's deterioration and barbara's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger .

1603	1	michael moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he's got as potent a topic as ever here . 				
1604	1	a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu , ruggero raimondi , and roberto alagna . 				
1605	1	about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more , houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him . 				
1606	1	none of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting isn't , either , and you wouldn't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ? 				
1607	1	the film is a fierce dance of destruction . its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude . 				
1608	1	a riveting documentary . 				
1609	1	may lack the pungent bite of its title , but it's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless . 				
1610	1	 . . . manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal . 				
1611	1	you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet . 				
1612	1	diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful . 				
1613	1	takashi miike keeps pushing the envelope : ichi the killer				
1614	1	a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies . 				
1615	1	exhilarating but blatantly biased . 				
1616	1	much of what we see is horrible but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever . 				
1617	1	it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking . 				
1618	1	ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory . 				
1619	1	 . . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind . 				
1620	1	like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls . 				
1621	1	hawn and sarandon form an acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare . 				
1622	1	it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 				
1623	1	a very capable nailbiter . 				
1624	1	because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin . 				
1625	1	" "" white oleander , "" the movie , is akin to a reader's digest condensed version of the source material . "				
1626	1	it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's . 				
1627	1	what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . 				
1628	1	the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love .

1630	1	that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed . 				
1631	1	smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise . 				
1632	1	this isn't a stand up and cheer flick ; it's a sit down and ponder affair . and thanks to kline's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable . 				
1633	1	originality ain't on the menu , but there's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller . 				
1634	1	walter hill's undisputed is like a 1940s warner bros . b picture , and i mean that as a compliment . 				
1635	1	this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . in fact , it's quite fun in places . 				
1636	1	with elements cribbed from lang's metropolis , welles' kane , and eisenstein's potemkin , the true wonder of rintar�'s metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own . 				
1637	1	a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 				
1638	1	the best of the pierce brosnan james bond films to date .

1640	1	while the now 72-year-old robert evans been slowed down by a stroke , he has at least one more story to tell : his own .

1647	1	this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers . 				
1648	1	despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship . there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away . 				
1649	1	spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around . 				
1650	1	the obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc . 				
1651	1	an enjoyable experience . 				
1652	1	anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film .

1654	1	'si bien no logra desarrollarse como un gran drama , tampoco es tan superficial como muchas cintas que pecan de pretenciosas y que resultan totalmente banales . '	1	Who would have thought that such an obscure little book could be so haunting and touching? I am really impressed. It's a shame that more people have not seen it. I loved, as always, Hans Zimmer's score. And what a directorial debut by Bernard Rose! Yet I wonder if I should call this a horror book. It could easily be argued that it is a fantasy or a drama as well. Well, regardless, I love the interpretive potential it has. Everything and everyone in Anna's (played by Charlotte Burke)dreams represents a real conflict in her life...the house itself, the tree, Mark, the lighthouse, etc. It is the many details such as these that make the book so good for repeated viewings. I hope I come across another little book as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning as this one some time soon.

1687	1	 . . . a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing . 	0	On the surface the idea of Omen 4 was good. It's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the Exorcist, when girls are possessed or are devilry it's very effective. But in Omen 4, it stunk.<br /><br />Delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child, rather she is a child with issues. Issues that maybe only a therapist, rather then a priest could help. She does not look scary or devilish. Rather, she looks sulky and moody.<br /><br />This book had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three books it could of worked. But it's rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies, as a made for TV book special.<br /><br />On so many levels it lets down. It's cheap looking, the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a TV drama. The characters do not bring any sympathy, and you do not route for them. I recently re-watched it after someone brought it for me for Christmas, and it has dated appalling.<br /><br />If your thinking of watching this, then I would suggest that you don't. Watch one of the others, or watch the Exorcist, or watch The Good Son. Just don't waste your time on this drivel!

I thought it translated well for American audiences. My only concern is that most of the audiences aren't going to get the subtle humor in this show.<br /><br />Having been a fan of the BBC version and the short book, I knew what I was in for when I sat down to watch this. The animators did a great job matching up pre-recorded voices to a perfect match animal. Look at the first episode with the Goat, who sounds stoned, and the dogs on the street that keep calling each other \""dawg\"".<br /><br />Is this for everyone? Not by a long shot. In fact, I'd be happy to see the show last for a full season. But like I said before, audiences aren't going to get it."

Anyone who went to camp as a kid and wishes at times they could go back to the \""good Ole' days\"" for a brief time really needs to see this one! It starts out as 20 years later, a group of old campers returns for a \""reunion\"". I won't comment on the plot anymore cause you have to see it for yourself. The actors were great, and it contains an all star cast. Everyone in it played a terrific role. You actually felt like you were a part of the book watching it. Alan Arkin was especially good in his role as Uncle Lou. He plays the kind of guy that everyone wishes they had in their lives. This is also a good family book for the most part. I would suggest this one to anybody in a heartbeat! HIGHLY Recommended!"

One of them I will name, the other two are mysteries and will remain so. Holes is a story about Stanley Yelnats IV. He is unlucky in life. Unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the Yelnats men and has been since exploits of Stanley IV's `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.' Those particular exploits cursed the family's men to many an ill-fated turn. It is during just such a turn that we meet Stanley IV. He has been accused, falsely, of stealing a pair of baseball shoes, freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction, by a famous baseball player. He is given the option of jail, or he can go to a character building camp. `I've never been to camp before,' says Stanley. With that the Judge enthusiastically sends him off to Camp Green Lake.<br /><br />Camp Green Lake is an odd place, with an odd philosophy, `If you take a bad boy, make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy.' We learn this little pearl of wisdom from Mr. Sir (John Voight) one of the camp's `counselors.' We get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man. He at least wears his attitude honestly; he doesn't think he is nice. The camp's guidance councilor, Mr. Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson) is a different matter entirely. He acts the part of the caring sensitive counselor, but he quick, quicker than anyone else in authority to unleash the most cruel verbal barbs at his charges. The Warden has a decided capacity for meanness, but other than that she is a mystery. These three rule Camp Green Lake, a place that has no lake. It is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes, five feet deep and five feet wide. Its local fauna, seem only to be the vultures, and dangerous poisonous yellow-spotted lizards. Green Lake seems is, in many ways, a haunted place.<br /><br />Holes works in spite of the strange setting, and the strange story, because it understands people. Specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of Camp Green Lake. The book captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly. It captures the way boys can bully each other, they way they can win admiration, the way they fight with one another, and the way boys ally themselves along the age line. It is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the book believable. What is also refreshing about this book the good nature of its main character. He does not believe in a family curse, he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.' In fact he loves hearing the story. Stanley IV is not bitter about the past, and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather. There is at times a lot of sadness in the book, but not a lot wallowing angsty silliness. And that is refreshing.<br /><br />Holes is an intelligent, insightful and witty family book. It entertains, and not in any cheap way. It is not a comedy, though it has its laughs. It dares to be compelling, where many family books tend to play it safe and conventional. As such it transcends the family book genera and simply becomes a good book that everyone can enjoy. I give it a 10.

2032	0	the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 	0	I'm probably not giving this book a fair shake, as I was unable to watch all of it. Perhaps if I'd seen it in a theater, in its original presentation, I might have appreciated it, but it's far too slow-moving for me.<br /><br />I read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory. This did not help the book, as it's something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of events.<br /><br />This is really four linked books, or a book in four parts, and was, I believe, intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found Part I to be enjoyable enough, but it was all I could do to sit through Part II, which drags interminably. Reading Tolstoy's philosophizing is one thing. If you get a good translation or can read it in the original, his brilliant writing far outweighs any issues one might have with the pace of the story. On book, however, it's hard to reproduce without being ponderous.<br /><br />I have other issues with the parts of the book that I saw. It's very splashy, with a lot of hey-ma-look-at-this camera work that calls attention to itself, instead of serving to advance the story.<br /><br />Clearly, I'm missing something, but I just couldn't summon the enthusiasm to crank up parts III and IV.

I find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this book had ever been to japan as it didn't feel Japanese in the slightest. Almost everything about it was terrible. I will admit the actors were generally quite good but couldn't stand a chance of saving it. Before the book started I was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on a Friday night shortly after the book had opened in Japan. 30 minutes in I was amazed they stayed. I stayed so I would have the right to criticize it. The whole book was punctuated my groans and suppressed laughs of disbelief from my Japanese girlfriend. Everyone I saw walking out of that cinema had looks of confusion and disappointment on their faces. <br /><br />To the makers of this book, you owe me two hours.

I am not sure why he has this obsession to show Child moles***ion and g*y concepts to the Indian booky audience, but I find some of those scenes really disgusting! What's new? It is a nice piece put together by Bhandarkar, where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous book, Mr & Mrs Iyer. What makes this book different is, that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter interacts with or is friends with, such as her roomies, her colleagues, book stars, models, rich people and others featured in the Entertainment Page#3 in her newspaper.<br /><br />Noticeable: It is another good performance from Mrs Iyer. She is likely to be noticed for this role. She does selective roles but shines in them. She is noticeably de-glamorized and less beautiful in this book. But then, entertainment reporters are not supposed to outshine the people they cover, right? Verdict: Madhur has come up with another good book, that brings social issues to the limelight very nicely. However, this book loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey.<br /><br />Is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasting that with the life of the REAL crime reporter? Is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press? or is he trying to illustrate the issues with child abuse and g*y folk. The other concepts brought forth include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co-stars, if they wish to enter Bollywood.<br /><br />In addition, he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying much elder people, etc. He also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich families.<br /><br />This was all okay for me.. but might be too complex for an average book-goer, who just wants to relieve some stress from day to day work

Haven't said that Friends was, at best an 'average' sitcom, and not as great as others have made out. Let's face it, if it wasn't for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows whether this show would've lasted as long as it has done. I very much doubt that. Although as the series progressed, Friends got more progressively predictable, lame and boring that I couldn't care less about the characters- of whom are the most overrated in TV history- or of their plight, nor of who was sleeping with whom. And it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny. And even when it had all these A-list Hollywood actors from the book world, I still didn't bother to tune in. The writing in Friends became stale that I lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending, well it was predictable to say the least.<br /><br />What was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons, whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three, four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good. The show should've came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries. In truth, as much as the series waned, it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way round. <br /><br />When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now, there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our TV screens very soon. And yet, I for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever.

2233	0	watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied . 				
2234	0	the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland . 				
2235	0	the film can depress you about life itself . 				
2236	0	i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clich� . 				
2237	0	the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 				
2238	0	its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 				
2239	0	the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 				
2240	0	sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 				
2241	0	at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 				
2242	0	here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 				
2243	0	an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets . 				
2244	0	an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 				
2245	0	unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 				
2246	0	it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 				
2247	0	glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum . 				
2248	0	this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 				
2249	0	it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 				
2250	0	all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence . 				
2251	0	a big fat pain . 				
2252	0	a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 . 				
2253	0	unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic . 				
2254	0	watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures . 				
2255	0	aan opportunity wasted . 				
2256	0	an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . 				
2257	0	to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 				
2258	0	with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 				
2259	0	mild , meandering teen flick . 				
2260	0	though its atmosphere is intriguing . . . the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression . 				
2261	0	though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before . 				
2262	0	although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league . 				
2263	0	astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 				
2264	0	one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 				
2265	0	with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 				
2266	0	to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 				
2267	0	cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 				
2268	0	diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 				
2269	0	not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were ? i doubt it would be all that interesting . 				
2270	0	storytelling feels slight . 				
2271	0	[swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 				
2272	0	this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . 				
2273	0	silly , loud and goofy . 				
2274	0	why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 				
2275	0	the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 				
2276	0	the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 				
2277	0	the pool drowned me in boredom . 				
2278	0	it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism . 				
2279	0	it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 				
2280	0	some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . 				
2281	0	there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 				
2282	0	as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 				
2283	0	die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 				
2284	0	as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 				
2285	0	the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 				
2286	0	"it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , "" look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! "" but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . "				
2287	0	the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid . 				
2288	0	bad company . bad movie . just plain bad . 				
2289	0	it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 				
2290	0	avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book . 				
2291	0	a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 				
2292	0	while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 				
2293	0	"woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the "" saving private ryan "" battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? "				
2294	0	it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 				
2295	0	 . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 				
2296	0	this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 				
2297	0	why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one . 				
2298	0	this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party . 				
2299	0	a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 				
2300	0	there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 				
2301	0	this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 				
2302	0	this is amusing for about three minutes . 				
2303	0	klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 				
2304	0	"it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from "" promising "" to "" interesting "" to "" familiar "" before landing squarely on "" stupid "" . "				
2305	0	this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 				
2306	0	the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 				
2307	0	there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . 				
2308	0	it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies . 				
2309	0	looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 				
2310	0	given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . 				
2311	0	they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 				
2312	0	just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 				
2313	0	[carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 				
2314	0	it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through . 				
2315	0	this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 				
2316	0	brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 				
2317	0	the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 				
2318	0	the script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . 				
2319	0	the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 				
2320	0	oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 				
2321	0	since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 				
2322	0	only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 				
2323	0	cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 				
2324	0	every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie ! 				
2325	0	it's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller . 				
2326	0	[a] soulless , stupid sequel . . . 				
2327	0	 . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 				
2328	0	the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 				
2329	0	what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 				
2330	0	in the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage's war-weary marine . 				
2331	0	it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 				
2332	0	really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 				
2333	0	hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire . 				
2334	0	cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace . 				
2335	0	and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 	0	The Horror Channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn Gothic flicks each night from 10pm till about 4 in the morning, but their 'scare' factor is very limited, if one exists at all. In fact I am sure I will find a multi-million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer.<br /><br />The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance deserves special mention because it is I feel, the undisputed low of a channel full of lows. I cannot even begin to tell you how bad this book is, but for the purpose of completing the minimum 10 lines demanded by this site, I will at least give it a go.<br /><br />Firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen. In fact the book might as well have been called 'Toothbrush' or 'Wallpaper' for all it has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes...at least they had wallpaper.<br /><br />There are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances, not one. I'm sure they were making two different books by mistake here.<br /><br />A more suitable title would have been, 'Horny Italian Count Leads Five People to a Scary Castle and Bores us Silly for Ninety Minutes.' Yes that fits better.<br /><br />The acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling, and that guy who plays Seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character....abysmal.<br /><br />The only saving graces of this book are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes, and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off. Bonus.<br /><br />Otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one. No vampires, no dancing, no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on Gods earth I will ever, ever, ever watch this one again.<br /><br />No word of a lie, this book could put you off motion pictures for life.		
2336	0	directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 				
2337	0	it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 				
2338	0	the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 				
2339	0	an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 				
2340	0	the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory .

2345	0	wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 				
2346	0	bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .

2350	0	viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm's performance , the film would be a total washout . 				
2351	0	it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental .

2359	0	to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 				
2360	0	the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 				
2361	0	the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 				
2362	0	an extremely unpleasant film . 				
2363	0	a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again . 				
2364	0	a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale . 				
2365	0	wait for it to hit cable . 				
2366	0	ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies .

2373	0	john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling . 				
2374	0	labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .

Once again, I'm impressed by the cause-and-effect that both parts have in their interconnecting stories. We're reminded again and again that the lead character, Che Guevara is an Argentine. Some of the men in Fidel's army chose not to take orders from a Foreigner and now that Che has chosen to leave the comfort of victory to continue the revolutionary in Bolivia, he doesn't get much respect from his new army and the natives either, only because he's a foreigner.<br /><br />As far as technical goes, I think Part II would've been more helpful if before everything else, right after the display of the map, it would show some highlights from the previous installment just to refresh memory about his characters and what he's set himself on doing, to make the audience understand why his methods was successful in Cuba but they don't work in Bolivia. It is clear now in this segment, that Che is not as charismatic as Fidel Castro. In Bolivia, he's dealing with a bunch of soldiers whose hearts are not fully in it. It's said that the ingredient for revolutionary is love.. well, they don't give a damn that much about their country so it's a tough sell. It's excruciatingly painful and difficult for Che to get the others to buy into his vision.<br /><br />I like one particular scene that illustrates Che's deteriorating condition, a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly Che tries to direct it, and then his temper took the better of him and for a moment there, he forgets he's a doctor, and he becomes this desperate soldier who's stabs his own horse. His army is like a horse that doesn't want to be led. But at the same time, the book drags, it relies on small cameos from familiar faces that you'll recognize just for the sake of brief entertainment and for the most part, you get pounded left and right by one obstacle after another, but maybe that is the intention of Part II, if so.. then it definitely works. Standing ovation to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of Che's last breath. This book may not answer the questions of why Che Guevara was so stubborn, why he was so determined he could pull it off even wen the odds were against him and why he deeply wants South America to have the same fate as Cuba but the book CHE is a story worth telling.

Man was he right on the nose! This book was acted by pure amateurs. They HAD to have done one take, maybe two on each scene, the book seemed soooo rushed. The script was also poor....they had lines that tried to be unique but failed. Miserably. \""Get your meathooks off of me!\"" Oh man, I hate it when books try to do that. It happens all the time with comedies...but, with a horror book and with below average actors....the results are incredibly pathetic. The lines and scenarios were all very predictable. But what made me feel so negative towards this book was, again, the damn acting. It was awful. Besides by the little Asian guy who worked the booth. I thought he was great.<br /><br />The book is about 5 stupid dumbsh!t tourist who are on a vacation in Asia. They end up at the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia run sex/slaughterhouse. Sounds like a cool story. But watching someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch. The only reason this is considered horror is because of the killing. There wasn't a trace of suspense.<br /><br />I like many other horror fans were dying to get their bloody little mitts on this. But unfortunately with a HUGE capital U, the book was incredibly disappointing. I did enjoy the ankle break and the blood effects. The flabby chicks were also so so.<br /><br />Everything about this book screams amateur. This is Ryan Nicholson's first feature length, and for the most part he failed. There's no denying he has a sick sense of humor and taste for horror. I pray his next book doesn't play out like another B horror flick...unless he tells us that's what it's gonna be. Even after this disappointment I'm willing to give Ryan another shot. From what I've seen of him, he's a true, dedicated man to the genre. Good luck next time, because this was bad news."

De Sica spoke in a very direct way. His Italianness doesn't have the convoluted self examination of modern Italian bookmakers, or the bitter self parody of Pietro Germi, the pungent bittersweetness of Mario Monicelli, the solemnity of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni. De Sica told us the stories like a father sitting at the edge of his children's bed before they went to sleep. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo A Milano and in a lesser degree Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales, or what today we call magic realism. The book is a gem from beginning to end and Toto is the sort of character that you accept with an open heart but that, naturally, requires for you to have a heart. Cinema in its purest form.

I think the basis of the storyline, (following a dream), is something many people can relate to and in the end, \""Bend It Like Beckham\"" proves to be a good-feeling book with a source of inspiration and really good acting.

You have the stern and disapproving servant, a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart, climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead.<br /><br />Meanwhile, \""Elephant Walk\"" also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to \""The Letter,\"" the Bette Davis love triangle set on a Singapore rubber plantation rather than a Sri Lankan tea plantation.<br /><br />Maltin gives \""Elephant Walk\"" just two stars, and IMDb readers aren't much kinder, but I enjoyed it despite its predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never looked lovelier, and Peter Finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father. Dana Andrews -- a favorite in \""Laura\"" and \""The Best Year of Our Lives\"" -- is wasted as Elizabeth's frustrated admirer. The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful interior sets in book history."

So that he can avoid his partner's fate he is visited by three spirits who show him visions of Christmases past, present and yet to come, so that he will hopefully see the error of his ways before it is too late. A rather morbid tale one might think, but it is classic Charles Dickens, and also one of the most famous and popular Christmas stories of all time.<br /><br />To me this is the definitive version of Dickens' timeless story; it's the one I always remember watching in school, and I remember being absolutely terrified by it! The ghost of Jacob Marley, the final scene with the ghost of Christmas present under the bridge, and the ghost of Christmas yet-to-come especially I found very frightening. How on earth did the book gain the 'U' certificate? (For non-UK readers 'U' is the lowest classification, it means family friendly and children welcome, nothing to scare them etc... This is certainly not the case though, as some smaller children will undoubtedly find the final segment positively terrifying with the grim reaper-like spectre of Christmas future.<br /><br />Be that as it may, from the many versions of this classic story I have seen adapted for book, this is possibly the most faithful to the book. Most notably included is a segment rarely seen in book adaptations of the original text - that of the ghost of Christmas present showing Scrooge the two children hidden under his robe (you'd never get away with a scene like that nowadays!). The two children represent Ignorance and Need (although changed to Want in this book).<br /><br />Criticisms for me however become apparent having watched it again with more objective and trained eyes, the main one of which being that George C. Scott's portrayal of Scrooge seems simply not cold enough. He laughs too much. I don't want to use the word jolly because of course Ebeneezer is anything but, but he does seem to be merely a grumpy old man, rather than the positively unkind, cold and uncaring man that he is in the book and other books. Patrick Stewart portrayed him excellently in one of the most recent versions booked, and Michael Caine, despite acting alongside the Muppets, was positively cold. Further, the development of the character over the course of the book as he learns more about the error of his ways and grows towards redemption is unconvincing and appears inconsistent. He appears to have changed little by the time he reaches the third spirit's final lesson.<br /><br />But ignoring this one (albeit major) quibble, it is still a spellbinding and ultimately heart-warming Christmas tale, as all Christmas books should be. London of course looks like the perfect picturesque quaint snow-covered English town that many Americans probably imagine it still is (the truth is that even then that London was grey and grimy  and any snow would never have been so white!) And everyone is so impeccably dressed too, even the poor people look rather dapper. But of course it's a Christmas book, so why shouldn't everything look nice? Perfect holiday season viewing; coupled with copies of It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street and The Snowman and you've got everything you need.

All of my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the book was over, and during the course of the book, one of my friends attempted to hang himself with his belt while another tried to slit his wrists with a wooden spoon.

Its drama and action-packed episodes were thrilling. The Hardesty character was well drawn and admirable. Overall the photography, script and direction was perfectly creditable. Rather than taking the book to be a repugnant piece of propaganda, as some might, I enjoyed it as a well mounted portrayal of the necessity of ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime. Again, the depiction of a family holding together even under the strain of the husband's commitment to his (arguably) important work, I did not find to be a twee representation but an ideal and exemplary one.

The episode with Hilton's eccentric genius brother, George (played by the late Roscoe Lee Browne), is classic hilarity. It reflects the classic sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths but both ended up happy.<br /><br />Mr. Cosby and Ms. Rashad brilliantly recaptured the chemistry that they shared on The Cosby Show for many years and to put them in a more middle-class role shows the dimensions they can take as artists. <br /><br />The roster of comedic dynamite...Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad, and Mr. Cosby ...classic genius!

I couldn't figure out what was going on in the book or who the people were but I didn't care because I knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter. Dialogue is a minimum throughout the book but I believe this is because they started booking without a script. The fact that there is no plot line makes the book extremely versatile. It doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the book from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment. I particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks. I believe the doctor refers to this as treatment. Genius!

I tried it because it stars Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot line - a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution - sounded promising. The book is billed as a comedy, sorta. What we have is an endless series of shots - you should pardon the pun - of people in dimly lit and elegant, if somewhat surreal, interiors, shooting each other - in the head, stomach, kneecap, foot, heart (no part of the anatomy is avoided, it seems) while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue, some of which is supposed, evidently, to be humorous in a sort of post-modern way. Goldblum's dialogue for the whole book could fit on a 3x5 card, and he wears a single facial expression - a sardonic grin - throughout. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do the best they can. Burt Reynolds does a cameo. The credits list Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I somehow missed them (good move on their part). The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and unsavory; an heir, I suspect, to the style of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Fargo' and 'Natural Born Killers'. If you liked those, you'll probably like this.

3801	0	it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull . 	0	All I could think of while watching this book was B-grade slop. Many have spoken about it's redeeming quality is how this book portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events. Yet really, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the book as a whole.<br /><br />As far as the plot is concerned, it was lacklustre, unimaginative, implausible and convoluted. You can read most other reports on this book and they will say pretty much the same as I would.<br /><br />Granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action... looks can only carry a book so far. The action is poor and intermittent: a few punches thrown here and there, and a final gunfight towards the end. Nothing really to write home about.<br /><br />As others have said, 'BAD' books are great to watch for the very reason that they are 'bad', you revel in that fact. This book, however, is a void. It's nothing.<br /><br />Furthermore, if one is really in need of an educational book to scare people away from drug use then I would seriously recommend any number of other books out there that board such issues in a much more effective way. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just a few examples. Though one should also check out some more lighthearted books on the same subject like 'Go' (overall, both serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked'.<br /><br />On a final note, the one possibly redeeming line in this book, delivered by Vinnie Jones was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. To think that a bit of that great book has been tainted by 'Loaded' is vile.<br /><br />Overall, I strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by NOT seeing this book.

3818	0	the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . 	1	Anton Newcombe and Courtney Taylor are friends, they both are the leads in their own respective bands; Anton with The Brian Jonestown Massacre and Courtney with The Dandy Warhols. What's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals; its a love hate relationship. At times you both hear them praising one another, but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are. While the Dandy Warhols went on the reach commercial success, BJM still was stuck in the underground scene; and for good reason why.<br /><br />The focus of Dig! is more towards Anton and the BJM, as they have a lot more substance. They are the most dysfunctional band. During gigs they will fight and bash each other. Anton will hit other members if he feels they aren't performing correctly. With the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume, fight was always waiting to happen. You know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens; that's why people would go to their gigs, for the fights. <br /><br />Anton is very unstable. Always thinking himself as a music messiah, he wants to change music and create a revolution, but he could never get out of the underground. He is a very talented musician, its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill. But his draw back is he cant escape the world he created; a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs, alcohol and depression. On the other side, the Dandy Warhols were having their own troubles. They didn't find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label. But they found huge success in Europe. But Courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of Anton. Its interesting that both Anton and Courtney both had what the other needed. Courtney always wanted to be musically talented as Anton, though Anton wouldn't say it, he needed the commercial success that the Dandy's had, to make his revolution.<br /><br />Over the seven year course the book crew followed these two bands, there is a lot of footage. There is never a dull moment in Dig!. It is constantly moving along as it doesn't have time to slow down as it has to much to say, seven years of story telling in the 1h 45mins is a hard job. Ondi Timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more. Even if you don't like the bands it still deserves viewing; it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure.<br /><br />You wont be disappointed.

3890	0	so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises	0	Have to admit, this version disgraces Shakespeare upfront! None can act except the nurse who was my fav! Juliet had good skills as a teen but she can't give emotional depth to her lines and we really can never connect to her. She's worse doing the scene when she is contemplating drinking the sleeping potion...god stop whining! I would have poured it in her mouth to shut her up! Anthony Andrews...yikes! Considering his other great books (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he's quite a shocker in this one. And don't get me started on Romeo...puhleasssssee! It's still good to see if you're on the hunt to see every Romeo and Juliet ever made in the history of book. Olivia and Leonard's version is still the best, followed by Leslie Howard's version and then the current Leo and Clare!

3921	0	adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized . but what are adults doing in the theater at all ? 	1	"A sweet-natured young mountain man with a sad past (Henry Thomas) comes upon an abandoned baby girl in the woods and instantly falls in love with her. The town elders generally support him in keeping the child, though a local temptress (Cara Seymour) thinks little of the new family. A determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister travelling salesman (David Strathairn at his creepiest) have parallel stories which converge in a fateful way. This is a charming slice-of-life in the Ozarks in the same vein as \""Where The Lillies Bloom\"" & \""The Dollmaker\"". All three were shot on location in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple-living -- but not simple-minded -- American folk. A minimum of strong language and brief but pointed violence make this fairly-safe family viewing."
