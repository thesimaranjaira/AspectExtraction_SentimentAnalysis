3023	secretary manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie . 
3024	judith and zaza's extended bedroom sequence . . . is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics .

3026	a knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor . 
3027	as i settled into my world war ii memories , i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances .

3029	it's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor . 
3030	the trinity assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and george ratliff's documentary , hell house , reflects their earnestness ? which makes for a terrifying film . 
3031	confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture . 
3032	an intoxicating experience . 
3033	a special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento . . .

3040	[a] real pleasure in its laid-back way . 
3041	some may choose to interpret the film's end as hopeful or optimistic but i think payne is after something darker . 
3042	though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history . 
3043	a much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe . 
3044	notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour , i'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
3045	a well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity . 
3046	the film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it's in danger of going wrong . 
3047	my big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as 'a perfect family film , ' because it's about family . 
3048	would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
3049	 . . . with the gifted pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself . 
3050	a movie that's just plain awful but still manages to entertain on a guilty-pleasure , so-bad-it's-funny level . 
3051	a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv's big brother . 
3052	functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing . 
3053	with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families . 
3054	a mess , but it's a sincere mess . 
3055	this odd , distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film . 
3056	for a debut film , skin of man , heart of beast feels unusually assured . 
3057	a photographic marvel of sorts , and it's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community . 
3058	it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career . 
3059	although olivier assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation . . . its three-hour running time plays closer to two . 
3060	a jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every clich� of japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage . 
3061	terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man . 
3062	parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam's subconscious , pressed through kafka's meat grinder and into bu�uel's casings
3063	'like a child with an important message to tell . . . [skins'] faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty . '
3064	a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies . 
3065	an escapist confection that's pure entertainment . 
3066	the ring is worth a look , if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your halloween entertainment . 
3067	the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments . . . but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much . 
3068	reassuring , retro uplifter . 
3069	throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love's brief moment . 
3070	armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud . 
3071	a decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit franklin needs to stay afloat in hollywood . 
3072	begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish . 
3073	one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time . 
3074	after an uncertain start , murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock's memorable first interrogation of gosling . 
3075	the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard . 
3076	a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
3077	an emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema . 
3078	enticing and often funny documentary . 
3079	going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy , but it's worth it , even if it does take 3 hours to get through . 
3080	a portrait of hell so shattering it's impossible to shake . 
3081	almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called 'the gift of tears . '
3082	better than the tepid star trek : insurrection ; falls short of first contact because the villain couldn't pick the lint off borg queen alice krige's cape ; and finishes half a parsec ( a nose ) ahead of generations . 
3083	at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live ) , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
3084	tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun . 
3085	majidi's direction has never been smoother or more confident . 
3086	visually captivating . 
3087	what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is . 
3088	hard , endearing , caring , warm . bring tissues . 
3089	a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world . 
3090	" "" me without you "" is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades . "
3091	inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
3092	though frodo's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle . 
3093	it's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 
3094	pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance . 
3095	ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented , and based on three short films and two features , here's betting her third feature will be something to behold .

3099	a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth . 
3100	devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable . 
3101	fulfills the minimum requirement of disney animation . 
3102	a moving , if uneven , success . 
3103	 with one exception , every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big , comforting jar of marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness . 
3104	wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture .

3107	until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , wendigo , larry fessenden's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films . 
3108	[woo's] most resonant film since the killer .

3110	a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish .

3117	a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it's potentially just as rewarding .

3121	a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life .

3123	if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 
3124	as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth . 
3125	blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew . 
3126	instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . 
3127	k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia .

3134	while the story's undeniably hard to follow , iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce . 
3135	if you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time .

3138	[a] devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid holocaust drama . 
3139	a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony . 
3140	these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and i'm all for that .

3144	director peter kosminsky gives these women a forum to demonstrate their acting 'chops' and they take full advantage .

3148	remove spider-man the movie from its red herring surroundings and it's apparent that this is one summer film that satisfies . 
3149	the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen .

3151	the emperor's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality . 
3152	it's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible . 
3153	though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking . 
3154	there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out . 
3155	the message of such reflections--intentional or not--is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one . 
3156	gooding is the energetic frontman , and it's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences . 
3157	the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before .

3174	it's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast . 
3175	rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language . 
3176	a time machine , a journey back to your childhood , when cares melted away in the dark theater , and films had the ability to mesmerize , astonish and entertain .

3188	the year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them . 
3189	"although it doesn't always hang together -- violence and whimsy don't combine easily -- "" cherish "" certainly isn't dull . "
3190	the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins . 
3191	time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness . 
3192	an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves . 
3193	a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . 
3194	fubar is very funny , but not always in a laugh-out-loud way . 
3195	a diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of palestinian and israeli children . 
3196	slight but enjoyable documentary .

3203	a riveting story well told .

3205	a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message . 
3206	the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
3207	pretty good little movie . 
3208	by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre . 
3209	worse than 'silence of the lambs' better than 'hannibal'
3210	if you haven't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg's work . much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments . . . 
3211	[the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together . 
3212	an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans . 
3213	canada's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people .

3216	the film's messages of tolerance and diversity aren't particularly original , but one can't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters .

3219	yes , it's as good as you remember . in fact , even better . 
3220	hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining . 
3221	an uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , the grey zone does have a center , though a morbid one . 
3222	this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them . 
3223	a stirring road movie . 
3224	one of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense . 
3225	insanely hilarious ! i haven't laughed that hard in years ! 
3226	anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher .

3228	it may not be history ? but then again , what if it is ? ? but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while .

3230	this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic . 
3231	this ready-made midnight movie probably won't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun . 
3232	see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . 
3233	" . . . "" bowling for columbine "" remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film . . . "
3234	even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
3235	but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity .

3237	star/producer salma hayek and director julie taymor have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own .

3246	white oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that doesn't mean you won't like looking at it . 
3247	in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
3248	the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america . 
3249	it looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships . 
3250	not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly . 
3251	a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
3252	it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 
3253	there are moments of hilarity to be had . 
3254	refreshing . 
3255	a hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life . 
3256	[while the last metro] was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history . 
3257	one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning . 
3258	return to never land is reliable , standard disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages . 
3259	michael moore's latest documentary about america's thirst for violence is his best film yet . . . 
3260	suffice to say that after seeing this movie in imax form , you'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of tom hanks' face than his wife is . 
3261	like a tarantino movie with heart , alias betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing . 
3262	marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary . 
3263	a brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel . 
3264	a movie i loved on first sight and , even more important , love in remembrance .

3266	deserves a place of honor next to nanook as a landmark in film history . 
3267	murderous maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy . . . 
3268	this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . 
3269	the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 
3270	this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men . 
3271	at its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating . 
3272	fans of critics' darling band wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i am trying to break your heart . 
3273	the film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet . 
3274	[gosling's] combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character . 
3275	confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis . acting cannot be acted . 
3276	fulford-wierzbicki . . . deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen . 
3277	a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films . 
3278	it's a cool event for the whole family . maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again . 
3279	featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
3280	the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it . 
3281	a typically observant , carefully nuanced and intimate french coming-of-age film that is an encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that is too heavy for all that has preceded it . 
3282	less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself . 
3283	a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after the death of a child . 
3284	i don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do . 
3285	a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with . 
3286	diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . 
3287	entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately . . . dare i say , entertaining ! 
3288	the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . 
3289	terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
3290	with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill . 
3291	the re-release of ron howard's apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages . 
3292	very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience . 
3293	wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film . 
3294	it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . 
3295	a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood's comic-book adaptations . 
3296	this is a superior horror flick . 
3297	adaptation is simply brilliant . 
3298	smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem . 
3299	the pleasure of read my lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string . we're drawn in by the dark luster . 
3300	a haunting tale of murder and mayhem . 
3301	i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . cinematic poetry showcases the city's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . 
3302	it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . 
3303	one of the best rock documentaries ever . wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many . 
3304	ian holm conquers france as an earthy napoleon
3305	offers big , fat , dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in . ah , what the hell . 
3306	[sports] admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency . 
3307	a portrait of an artist . 
3308	directors brett morgen and nanette burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia . 
3309	the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow . 
3310	a tremendous piece of work . 
3311	a delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie . 
3312	while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
3313	labute masterfully balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other . something for everyone . 
3314	irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . 
3315	leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that's simultaneously painful and refreshing . 
3316	not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense . 
3317	'film aficionados cannot help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director's cut . '
3318	a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clich�s and showcases a group of dedicated artists . 
3319	it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process . 
3320	contradicts everything we've come to expect from movies nowadays . instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way , secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way . 
3321	could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . 
3322	murderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud . . . and parmentier . 
3323	filmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that doesn't always jell with sean penn's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it . 
3324	"there are a couple of things that elevate "" glory "" above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . "
3325	it's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . 
3326	 ( rises ) above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism . 
3327	a breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy . 
3328	kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor . 
3329	tsai ming-liang's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being . 
3330	leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time . 
3331	sean penn , you owe nicolas cage an apology . 
3332	the performances are uniformly good . 
3333	she's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness . 
3334	it's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it . 
3335	for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece . 
3336	the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro . . . couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment . 
3337	this in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come . 
3338	it shows us a slice of life that's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable . 
3339	a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture . 
3340	has its share of arresting images . 
3341	leave it to john sayles to take on developers , the chamber of commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie . . . without neglecting character development for even one minute . 
3342	reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies . 
3343	poignant and funny . 
3344	a smart little indie . 
3345	payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he's the best brush in the business . 
3346	see it . debate it . remember it . 
3347	try as you might to resist , if you've got a place in your heart for smokey robinson , this movie will worm its way there . 
3348	a riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades . 
3349	director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading . 
3350	stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 . 
3351	i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
3352	with not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis . 
3353	it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics . 
3354	slow and ponderous , but rohmer's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption . 
3355	if you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force . 
3356	austin powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later . 
3357	while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in . 
3358	cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio . 
3359	elvira fans could hardly ask for more . 
3360	a canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists . 
3361	the movie should be credited with remembering his victims . 
3362	fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough . 
3363	a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale . 
3364	hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation . 
3365	as if trying to grab a lump of play-doh , the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story , the more details slip out between his fingers . 
3366	my big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year , it's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss . 
3367	few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying . 
3368	another love story in 2002's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre . 
3369	it's another retelling of alexandre dumas' classic . why ? who knows , but it works under the direction of kevin reynolds . 
3370	[f]rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . 
3371	shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience . 
3372	provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already . 
3373	a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination . 
3374	this isn't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work . 
3375	overall , it's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : god is love . 
3376	it may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case . 
3377	although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 
3378	jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying . 
3379	the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all can't stand . 
3380	george clooney , in his first directorial effort , presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years . 
3381	even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking
3382	although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale . 
3383	a life-size reenactment of those jack chick cartoon tracts that always ended with some hippie getting tossed into the lake of fire . 
3384	grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors . 
3385	this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered . 
3386	the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer . 
3387	daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails . 
3388	 . . . in no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy , it doesn't disappoint . 
3389	clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , slap her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up . 
3390	cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression .

3503	brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression . 
3504	it's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 . 
3505	it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
3506	you can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , 'this is going to be something really good . ' and it is . 
3507	foster and whitaker are especially fine . she is a lioness , protecting her cub , and he a reluctant villain , incapable of controlling his crew . 
3508	undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos . 
3509	a movie that will wear you out and make you misty even when you don't want to be . 
3510	not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season . 
3511	though the story . . . is hackneyed , the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament . 
3512	although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work . 
3513	if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
3514	the climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does
3515	a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children's television . 
3516	all comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad . 
3517	if a horror movie's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well . . . a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride . 
3518	a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences . 
3519	brilliantly written and well-acted , yellow asphalt is an uncompromising film . 
3520	that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 
3521	personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us . 
3522	a fascinating literary mystery story with multiple strands about the controversy of who really wrote shakespeare's plays . 
3523	throughout , mr . audiard's direction is fluid and quick .

3527	the trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking ? because you get it . 
3528	nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you . he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty . 
3529	what it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart . 
3530	robert harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows . 
3531	genuinely unnerving . 
3532	american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone . 
3533	a compelling film . 
3534	with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
3535	in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 
3536	the heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death . 
3537	will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
3538	its director's most substantial feature for some time . 
3539	fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . 
3540	the son of the bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues . this movie is to be cherished . 
3541	 . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 
3542	the story's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr . day-lewis roars with leonine power . 
3543	p . t . anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible . 
3544	twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 
3545	this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . 
3546	it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . 
3547	this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be . 
3548	even through its flaws , revolution #9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film . 
3549	the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . 
3550	schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms . mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation . 
3551	lejos del para�so es al mismo tiempo una fiesta para los ojos y o�dos y un movilizador cuadro de personajes enfrentados a sus propios deseos , miedos y prejuicios . 
3552	watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power . 
3553	there is no denying the power of polanski's film . . . 
3554	the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat . 
3555	this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed .

3560	takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze . 
3561	a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart . 
3562	gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways . 
3563	witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy . 
3564	even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it's documenting . 
3565	got a david lynch jones ? then you'd do well to check this one out because it's straight up twin peaks action . . . 
3566	astonishing . . . [frames] profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment . 
3567	take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length . 
3568	it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile .

3570	rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material . 
3571	an elegant and sly deadpan comedy .

3578	the quiet american isn't a bad film , it's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar . 
3579	as home movie gone haywire , it's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i'd rather listen to old tori amos records . 
3580	in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film . 
3581	like an episode of mtv's undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance . . . indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper . 
3582	deliciously slow . 
3583	a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene's work as well as a remarkably faithful one .

3585	it's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .

3595	 . . . one of the more influential works of the 'korean new wave' .

3622	it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 
3623	a very capable nailbiter .

4128	 . . . quite endearing . 
4129	its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story . 
4130	in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
4131	this story of a determined woman's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments . 
4132	like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
4133	a modestly made but profoundly moving documentary . 
4134	it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2 , 500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . 
4135	not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker . it must be in the genes . 
4136	the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles . 
4137	this slight premise . . . works because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm as the aged napoleon . 
4138	hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u . s . -- a major director is emerging in world cinema . 
4139	although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey
4140	the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you won't be disappointed . 
4141	kudos to the most enchanting film of the year . 
4142	it works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory . 
4143	colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . 
4144	it's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today . 
4145	director paul cox's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing nijinsky's diaries is both stimulating and demanding . 
4146	for 95 often hilarious minutes , [cho] riffs on the diciness of colonics , on straight versus gay personal ads , on how men would act if they had periods , and on the perils of a certain outr� sexual practice . 
4147	most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there . 
4148	mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully . 
4149	best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . 
4150	[westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera . 
4151	a film that's flawed and brilliant in equal measure . 
4152	even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken . 
4153	ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness . 
4154	hardly a film that comes along every day . 
4155	harmless fun . 
4156	a wild ride with eight boarders from venice beach that was a deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival . 
4157	the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics . 
4158	a sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old welsh boy more curious about god than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter . 
4159	the film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public
4160	more intimate than spectacular , e . t . is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . 
4161	for once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own . 
4162	if you're burnt out on it's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol , it might just be the movie you're looking for . it depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept . 
4163	moonlight mile doesn't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy . 
4164	it is an indelible epic american story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives . 
4165	not as well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted . 
4166	quite simply , a joy to watch and--especially--to listen to . 
4167	a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds . 
4168	the filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him . 
4169	a winning and wildly fascinating work . 
4170	we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close . 
4171	worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance . 
4172	the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . 
4173	an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
4174	"a meatier deeper beginning and/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the "" a "" range , as is , it's a very very strong "" b+ . "" i love the robust middle of this picture . "
4175	the power of shanghai ghetto , a documentary by dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s . 
4176	maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts . 
4177	there is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all . paul cox needed to show it . it is up to you to decide if you need to see it . 
4178	if divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances . 
4179	if you ignore the cliches and concentrate on city by the sea's interpersonal drama , it ain't half-bad . 
4180	alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and isn't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience . 
4181	"there aren't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but "" elling "" manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year's most enjoyable releases . "
4182	reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . 
4183	an earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . 
4184	samuel beckett applied to the iranian voting process . 
4185	the bard as black comedy -- willie would have loved it . 
4186	another trumpet blast that there may be a new mexican cinema a-bornin' . 
4187	' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
4188	tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother . 
4189	this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . 
4190	as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
4191	it is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one . 
4192	trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness . 
4193	a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . 
4194	it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . 
4195	as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
4196	there's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one . 
4197	like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely . 
4198	a film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story . 
4199	kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story . parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults . 
4200	an unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud . 
4201	maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road . . . but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection . 
4202	much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep . 
4203	ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years . 
4204	spielberg's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later . 
4205	"the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a "" dungeons and dragons "" fantasy with modern military weaponry . . . "
4206	more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . . 
4207	what i saw , i enjoyed . 
4208	good-naturedly cornball sequel . 
4209	the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we've long associated with washington the actor . 
4210	a deft , delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph . 
4211	daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , biggie and tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation . 
4212	delivers more than its fair share of saucy hilarity . 
4213	a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard . . . and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels . 
4214	happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . 
4215	hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels . 
4216	it's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered . 
4217	it's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits . if only it had the story to match . 
4218	like other great documentaries . . . this goes after one truth ( the ford administration's complicity in tearing 'orphans' from their mothers ) and stumbles upon others even more compelling . 
4219	 . . . only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction . 
4220	the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there . 
4221	it's quite diverting nonsense . 
4222	an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts . 
4223	for all the wit and hoopla , festival in cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships . 
4224	what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching . 
4225	renner ? s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance . see it for his performance if nothing else . 
4226	 . . . the kind of entertainment that parents love to have their kids see . 
4227	it's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism . 
4228	its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads . 
4229	swimming is above all about a young woman's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds . 
4230	a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience . 
4231	it's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids . 
4232	an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naivet� and sophistication . 
4233	blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances . 
4234	while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them . 
4235	as a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious . yet it's not quite the genre-busting film it's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe . 
4236	you don't need to know your ice-t's from your cool-j's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california . 
4237	turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts
4238	meant for star wars fans . it is there to give them a good time . 
4239	from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
4240	simply and eloquently articulates the tangled feelings of particular new yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy . 
4241	provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust . 
4242	terrific performances , great to look at , and funny . a little uneven to be the cat's meow , but it's good enough to be the purr . 
4243	it's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america . 
4244	i like it . there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane . 
4245	that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film . 
4246	that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . 
4247	it's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen . 
4248	a sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy , while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , really isn't . 
4249	the script is smart , not cloying . 
4250	the film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence . 
4251	fred schepisi's tale of four englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point . 
4252	the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
4253	overall , cletis tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone . 
4254	easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year . 
4255	the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar . 
4256	an engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement . 
4257	insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances . 
4258	like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake . 
4259	i don't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie . 
4260	despite its flaws . . . belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn . 
4261	each punch seen through prison bars , the fights become not so much a struggle of man vs . man as brother-man vs . the man . 
4262	the evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear . 
4263	like the best of godard's movies . . . it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable . 
4264	horns and halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth . 
4265	oddly compelling . 
4266	[has] an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it's all true . 
4267	it treats ana's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film . 
4268	captivates as it shows excess in business and pleasure , allowing us to find the small , human moments , and leaving off with a grand whimper . 
4269	a refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age tale . 
4270	how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not . 
4271	great fun both for sports aficionados and for ordinary louts whose idea of exercise is climbing the steps of a stadium-seat megaplex . 
4272	features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film . 
4273	to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed . 
4274	one of the best movies of the year . 
4275	the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
4276	a superlative b movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing . 
4277	those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up . 
4278	witless but watchable . 
4279	like mike isn't going to make box office money that makes michael jordan jealous , but it has some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience ( young bow wow fans ) - with nothing but net . 
4280	[dong] makes a valiant effort to understand everyone's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up . 
4281	the trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them . 
4282	at its best , which occurs often , michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s . 
4283	a modestly surprising movie . 
4284	a headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox jews on the west bank , joseph cedar's time of favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity . 
4285	there's a spontaneity to the chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout . 
4286	the first tunisian film i have ever seen , and it's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i'm likely to see all year . 
4287	like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it's never too late to learn . 
4288	[kline's] utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who can't quite live up to it . 
4289	the film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness . 
4290	a thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy . 
4291	feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in nine queens . 
4292	leigh makes these lives count . and he allows a gawky actor like spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range . 
4293	a lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers . 
4294	promises is one film that's truly deserving of its oscar nomination . 
4295	what bubbles up out of john c . walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch . 
4296	if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time . 
4297	beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes . 
4298	ms . hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda's ultimate fate . 
4299	monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . 
4300	a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last . 
4301	[it's] a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest . 
4302	an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation . 
4303	nicole kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while . 
4304	vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two english women . 
4305	the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . the performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie . 
4306	manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state . 
4307	mr . deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy . 
4308	when you think you've figured out bielinsky's great game , that's when you're in the most trouble : he's the con , and you're just the mark . 
4309	a strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man . 
4310	driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm . . . the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs . 
4311	a well-put-together piece of urban satire . 
4312	"it's the sweet cinderella story that "" pretty woman "" wanted to be . "
4313	it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster . 
4314	what doesn't this film have that an impressionable kid couldn't stand to hear ? 
4315	what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice . 
4316	a deeply felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world . 
4317	it's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you don't try to look too deep into the story
4318	it's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good . 
4319	a full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence . 
4320	visually , 'santa clause 2' is wondrously creative . 
4321	the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact . 
4322	[raimi's] matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you'll ever see . 
4323	a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome . 
4324	a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism . 
4325	what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 
4326	the film has a kind of hard , cold effect . 
4327	the gags are often a stitch . 
4328	the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family . 
4329	a bonanza of wacky sight gags , outlandish color schemes , and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract frank tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist's career . 
4330	one can't deny its seriousness and quality . 
4331	good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make paid in full worth seeing . 
4332	this engrossing , characteristically complex tom clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time . 
4333	ryan gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel . 
4334	 . . . somehow manages to escape the shackles of its own clich�s to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks . 
4335	much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . 
4336	takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights . 
4337	with few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . 
4338	its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work . 
4339	provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views . 
4340	inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening . 
4341	hard to resist . 
4342	comedian , like its subjects , delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun , no-frills ride . 
4343	a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith's next movie . 
4344	pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly . 
4345	those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi . 
4346	a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing . 
4347	 . . . enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games . 
4348	sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before . 
4349	despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity . 
4350	to get at the root psychology of this film would require many sessions on the couch of dr . freud . 
4351	great over-the-top moviemaking if you're in a slap-happy mood . 
4352	viveka seldahl and sven wollter will touch you to the core in a film you will never forget -- that you should never forget . 
4353	the magic ( and original running time ) of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki's spirited away survives intact in bv's re-voiced version . 
4354	from the dull , surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait . 
4355	captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics . 
4356	it's not particularly subtle . . . however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion . 
4357	the auteur's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug . 
4358	bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness .

4606	khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum . 
4607	impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation . . . just about as chilling and unsettling as 'manhunter' was . 
4608	it's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but . 
4609	though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . 
4610	i simply can't recommend it enough . 
4611	wiseman reveals the victims of domestic abuse in all of their pity and terror . 
4612	muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex . 
4613	we want the funk - and this movie's got it . 
4614	wow , so who knew charles dickens could be so light-hearted ? 
4615	many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit . 
4616	sem se preocupar em criar momentos melodram�ticos para arrancar l�grimas do espectador , o pianista � um filme triste sem que , para isso , precise ser emocionante . 
4617	the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome . 
4618	a miraculous movie , i'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion . 
4619	baran is shockingly devoid of your typical majid majidi shoe-loving , crippled children . 
4620	an ambitious 'what if ? ' that works . 
4621	every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you're on the edge of your seat . 
4622	a fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats . 
4623	the series' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives remains prominent , as do the girls' amusing personalities . 
4624	richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings . 
4625	a compelling allegory about the last days of germany's democratic weimar republic . 
4626	offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory . 
4627	a b-movie you can sit through , enjoy on a certain level and then forget . 
4628	devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower . 
4629	disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself . 
4630	director todd solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates . 
4631	the word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer's tribute to a courageous scottish lady , is painterly . 
4632	a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it . 
4633	bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie . . . is , also , frequently hilarious . 
4634	really is a pan-american movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart . 
4635	obligada para impotentes , daneses , camareras italianas , profesores de idiomas , y todo aquel que desee una lengua para expresar su amor . 
4636	an overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort . 
4637	peppering this urban study with references to norwegian folktales , villeneuve creates in maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical . 
4638	ong's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent chinese immigrant's experiences in new york city . 
4639	fantastic ! 
4640	that the real antwone fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle . 
4641	there's not much to fatale , outside of its stylish surprises . . . but that's ok . 
4642	what redeems the film is the cast , particularly the ya-yas themselves . 
4643	beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that's there to scare while we delight in the images . 
4644	it's up to [watts] to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe . 
4645	the film is darkly atmospheric , with herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath hearst's forced avuncular chortles . 
4646	shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
4647	 . . . the story , like ravel's bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with . 
4648	it's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions . 
4649	gondry's direction is adequate . . . but what gives human nature its unique feel is kaufman's script . 
4650	the film's plot may be shallow , but you've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots . 
4651	"with a large cast representing a broad cross-section , tavernier's film bounds along with the rat-a-tat energy of "" his girl friday , "" maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes . "
4652	the observations of this social/economic/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony . 
4653	renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance . 
4654	jarecki and gibney do find enough material to bring kissinger's record into question and explain how the diplomat's tweaked version of statecraft may have cost thousands and possibly millions of lives . 
4655	the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart . 
4656	aniston has at last decisively broken with her friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil . 
4657	a mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book . 
4658	" "" the dangerous lives of altar boys "" has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors"
4659	unexpected , and often contradictory , truths emerge . 
4660	300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness . 
4661	intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being . 
4662	may take its sweet time to get wherever it's going , but if you have the patience for it , you won't feel like it's wasted yours . 
4663	less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling ( though no less horrifying for it ) . 
4664	the film is one of the year's best . 
4665	it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
4666	nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . 
4667	scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
4668	a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
4669	like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ? 
4670	this is so bad . 
4671	even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
4672	i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
4673	prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . 
4674	this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
4675	the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
4676	it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
4677	van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
4678	a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . 
4679	the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither . 
4680	every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
4681	scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! 
4682	is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
4683	there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television . 
4684	however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
4685	the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
4686	some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
4687	even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
4688	"comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , "" crossroads "" instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . "
4689	it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
4690	it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
4691	the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
4692	sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
4693	schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . 
4694	demands too much of most viewers . 
4695	the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
4696	it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
4697	shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
4698	aggravating and tedious . 
4699	the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . 
4700	the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt . 
4701	for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
4702	a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . 
4703	meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
4704	the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
4705	has the feel of an unedited personal journal . 
4706	remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more . 
4707	cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed . 
4708	this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
4709	"it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than "" confessions of a dangerous mind . "" "
4710	the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
4711	 . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
4712	unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
4713	the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . 
4714	lacks depth . 
4715	most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . 
4716	there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 
4717	audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
4718	under-rehearsed and lifeless
4719	the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
4720	you can practically smell the patchouli oil . 
4721	to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
4722	the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
4723	an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
4724	this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
4725	consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
4726	another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
4727	laughably , irredeemably awful . 
4728	moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
4729	there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
4730	the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden . 
4731	when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done . 
4732	tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool . 
4733	i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
4734	uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
4735	all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
4736	the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
4737	if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
4738	stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . 
4739	it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish . 
4740	culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character . 
4741	in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
4742	 . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
4743	a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek . 
4744	shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
4745	imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
4746	soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . 
4747	a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable . 
4748	the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
4749	it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb . 
4750	the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
4751	it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . 
4752	proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie . 
4753	well , it does go on forever . 
4754	this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
4755	topkapi this is not . 
4756	if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? 
4757	ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls . 
4758	equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
4759	i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
4760	while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
4761	if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
4762	a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect . 
4763	guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs . 
4764	audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
4765	to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
4766	it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . 
4767	credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . 
4768	i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve . 
4769	for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
4770	an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
4771	a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison . 
4772	yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
4773	it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
4774	this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
4775	 . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle . 
4776	literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
4777	arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie . 
4778	anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . 
4779	chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about . 
4780	a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . 
4781	unwieldy contraption . 
4782	the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
4783	marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
4784	the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
4785	if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . 
4786	so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
4787	this is junk food cinema at its greasiest . 
4788	when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . 
4789	most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
4790	the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business . 
4791	you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! 
4792	a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
4793	this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
4794	before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
4795	the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin . 
4796	instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
4797	a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker . 
4798	scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be . 
4799	the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix . 
4800	flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent . 
4801	a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
4802	the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
4803	" . . . instead go rent "" shakes the clown "" , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance . "
4804	lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
4805	it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
4806	this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through . 
4807	expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies . 
4808	nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clich�s and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
4809	it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
4810	might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
4811	every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
4812	arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces . 
4813	both awful and appealing . 
4814	the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary . 
4815	nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
4816	we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
4817	helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
4818	it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 . 
4819	i hated every minute of it . 
4820	[t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . 
4821	obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic . 
4822	there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
4823	a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
4824	roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut . 
4825	there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double . 
4826	anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
4827	ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
4828	if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films . 
4829	pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film . 
4830	not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies . 
4831	it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
4832	the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
4833	a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man . 
4834	director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person . 
4835	egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious . 
4836	it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
4837	despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing . 
4838	shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
4839	plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
4840	there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
4841	the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
4842	i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me . 
4843	despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart . 
4844	an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent . 
4845	birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
4846	de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest . 
4847	even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
4848	that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
4849	a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes . 
4850	"if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be "" how does steven seagal come across these days ? "" or maybe "" how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? "
4851	it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
4852	the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
4853	you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus . 
4854	dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick . 
4855	ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . 
4856	flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams . 
4857	little more than a frothy vanity project . 
4858	the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
4859	verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills . 
4860	for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
4861	the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
4862	alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
4863	the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller . 
4864	the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet . 
4865	the story really has no place to go since simone is not real?she can't provide any conflict . 
4866	ihops don't pile on this much syrup . 
4867	for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
4868	"focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her "" madness "" so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . "
4869	this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . 
4870	a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
4871	with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door . 
4872	the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
4873	the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens . 
4874	a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned . 
4875	 . . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats . 
4876	 . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
4877	 . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar . 
4878	it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
4879	it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
4880	largely a for-fans artifact . 
4881	there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
4882	characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better . 
4883	there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes . 
4884	[i]f you've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you've already seen this kind of thing . 
4885	first-time director jo?o pedro rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on . 
4886	no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either . 
4887	a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
4888	a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
4889	the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun ? toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout . 
4890	"when the first few villians are introduced as "" spider "" and "" snake "" you know you're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak . "
4891	an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
4892	the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
4893	[director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one . 
4894	so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler . 
4895	it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
4896	watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
4897	it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
4898	there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject . 
4899	overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper . 
4900	could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence . 
4901	i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . 
4902	the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare . 
4903	i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
4904	the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
4905	human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
4906	[it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
4907	not even the hanson brothers can save it
4908	the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
4909	 . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense . 
4910	a sour , nasty offering . 
4911	feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk . 
4912	obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
4913	it tells more than it shows . 
4914	earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material . 
4915	the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles . 
4916	pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick . 
4917	"not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school "" cartoon "" . "
4918	do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor . 
4919	nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them . 
4920	much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
4921	this is really just another genre picture . 
4922	each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
4923	william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
4924	a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
4925	neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn . 
4926	'carente de imaginaci�n , mal dirigida , peor actuada y sin un �pice de romance , es una verdadera p�rdida de tiempo y dinero'
4927	"acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes "" never again "" worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice"
4928	both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
4929	" "" collateral damage "" goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment ? until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief"
4930	'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances . 
4931	a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle . 
4932	i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't . 
4933	as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell . 
4934	like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
4935	the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do . 
4936	just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination . 
4937	there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
4938	where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
4939	why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ? 
4940	a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags . 
4941	 . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film . 
4942	lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
4943	though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
4944	perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
4945	wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn . 
4946	somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional . 
4947	this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack . 
4948	"is "" ballistic "" worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer . "
4949	the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
4950	sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
4951	kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
4952	imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring . 
4953	this time kaufman's imagination has failed him . 
4954	an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort . 
4955	"it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . "" interview "" loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into . "
4956	'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad . 
4957	frenetic but not really funny . 
4958	taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise . 
4959	if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
4960	a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy . 
4961	an awful snooze . 
4962	sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle . 
4963	you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing . 
4964	director clare kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been . 
4965	new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video . 
4966	wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
4967	the thrill is ( long ) gone . 
4968	just plain silly . 
4969	began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
4970	part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole . 
4971	godawful boring slug of a movie . 
4972	dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
4973	scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why . 
4974	 . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
4975	it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
4976	the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes . 
4977	vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship . 
4978	some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations . 
4979	being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
4980	offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
4981	mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
4982	thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
4983	aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
4984	accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
4985	for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . 
4986	a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
4987	one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
4988	although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours . 
4989	feeble comedy . 
4990	great story , bad idea for a movie . 
4991	with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry . 
4992	there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters . 
4993	it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins . 
4994	" "" my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! "" yes , you are , ben kingsley . "
4995	a dreadful live-action movie . 
4996	divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . 
4997	an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s . 
4998	a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
4999	all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
5000	between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap . 
5001	if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg . 
5002	despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another . 
5003	every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point . 
5004	a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at . 
5005	never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . 
5006	spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . 
5007	oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me . 
5008	the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine . 
5009	whatever eyre's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place . 
5010	scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole . 
5011	it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world . 
5012	the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it's all pretty cynical and condescending , too . 
5013	i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
5014	a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
5015	what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients . 
5016	with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
5017	flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat . 
5018	writhing under dialogue like 'you're from two different worlds' and 'tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability . 
5019	 . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
5020	is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ? 
5021	faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
5022	schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad . 
5023	it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
5024	scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . 
5025	when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
5026	there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career . 
5027	too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through . 
5028	the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra . 
5029	 . . . the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity . 
5030	the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . 
5031	if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
5032	a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers . 
5033	julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan . 
5034	morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either . 
5035	there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
5036	all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
5037	mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
5038	this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few . 
5039	this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing . 
5040	considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
5041	better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
5042	so clich�d that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
5043	it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
5044	it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
5045	when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility . 
5046	credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
5047	the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun . 
5048	[davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
5049	doesn't amount to much of anything . 
5050	bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
5051	so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly . 
5052	the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
5053	enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
5054	some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
5055	a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes . 
5056	a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
5057	a little too pat for its own good . 
5058	there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
5059	watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
5060	well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
5061	what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this . 
5062	when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that's a bad sign . a very bad sign . 
5063	it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story . 
5064	can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
5065	diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan . 
5066	i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
5067	so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
5068	the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
5069	the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie . 
5070	god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse . 
5071	let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home . 
5072	undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . 
5073	the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john . 
5074	rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
5075	you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original . 
5076	"plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on "" the simpsons "" has . "
5077	a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking . 
5078	the movie bounces all over the map . 
5079	"but buying into sham truths and routine "" indie "" filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre . "
5080	not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . 
5081	" "" juwanna mann ? "" no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . "
5082	it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original . 
5083	you're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous . 
5084	 . . . salaciously simplistic . 
5085	feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot . 
5086	some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one . 
5087	sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
5088	the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
5089	shallow . 
5090	begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
5091	a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it . 
5092	proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
5093	the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
5094	there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . 
5095	in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
5096	"director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of "" the longest yard "" playbook like a checklist . "
5097	the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
5098	oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring . 
5099	we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
5100	for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless . 
5101	one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
5102	what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
5103	we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again . 
5104	"opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled "" glory : a soldier's story . "" "
5105	the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
5106	these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
5107	a less-than-thrilling thriller . 
5108	a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
5109	matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy . 
5110	how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ? 
5111	everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
5112	with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
5113	its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer . 
5114	a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion . 
5115	the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness . 
5116	it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
5117	it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
5118	desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
5119	this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation . 
5120	john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
5121	director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
5122	borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
5123	as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
5124	the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected . 
5125	though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
5126	falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny . 
5127	the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
5128	anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
5129	all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull . 
5130	demme's loose approach kills the suspense . 
5131	this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
5132	[plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . 
5133	the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low . 
5134	nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
5135	a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
5136	too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . 
5137	if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . 
5138	trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
5139	it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun . 
5140	theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
5141	all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin . 
5142	sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
5143	the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch . 
5144	collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 
5145	dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
5146	its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
5147	a great idea becomes a not-great movie . 
5148	 . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might . 
5149	by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious . 
5150	not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny . 
5151	feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
5152	life is a crock -- or something like it . 
5153	made by jackasses for jackasses . 
5154	despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum . 
5155	the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn . 
5156	bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
5157	disjointed parody . 
5158	given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . 
5159	a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
5160	philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach . 
5161	despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles . 
5162	all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto . 
5163	not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well . 
5164	first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction . 
5165	this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
5166	it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
5167	even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
5168	so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
5169	sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece . 
5170	even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
5171	a long-winded , predictable scenario . 
5172	too close to phantom menace for comfort . 
5173	 . . . silly humbuggery . . . 
5174	although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke . 
5175	too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining . 
5176	this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
5177	it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
5178	melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . 
5179	at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
5180	a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless . 
5181	a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans . 
5182	the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety . 
5183	"good for a few unintentional laughs , "" extreme ops "" was obviously made for the "" xxx "" crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . "
5184	?a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason . 
5185	a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality . 
5186	lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
5187	as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all . 
5188	will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings . 
5189	just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . 
5190	choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
5191	 . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . 
5192	the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers . 
5193	if you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere . 
5194	it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
5195	an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
5196	despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one . 
5197	like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q . is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause . 
5198	adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
5199	what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
5200	beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
5201	without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
5202	drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
5203	there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
5204	unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it . wait for video -- and then don't rent it . 
5205	the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
5206	there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about . 
5207	too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
5208	when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested . 
5209	unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit . 
5210	the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
5211	[it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view . 
5212	the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
5213	taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess . 
5214	if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil . 
5215	the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense . 
5216	too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless . 
5217	overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring . 
5218	what is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form . 
5219	if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook . 
5220	had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
5221	these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
5222	imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno . 
5223	it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . 
5224	any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment . 
5225	the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
5226	about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
5227	apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
5228	opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
5229	the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction . 
5230	to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable . 
5231	too simple for its own good . 
5232	flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey . 
5233	a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 
5234	suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video . 
5235	the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
5236	a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience . 
5237	newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept ? a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
5238	"shouldn't have been allowed to use the word "" new "" in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . "
5239	often silly ? and gross ? but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
5240	the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
5241	it's exactly what you'd expect . 
5242	the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 
5243	a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men . 
5244	reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
5245	as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
5246	if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
5247	the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
5248	a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
5249	an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma . 
5250	too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing . 
5251	ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
5252	eh . 
5253	the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
5254	the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future . 
5255	if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead . 
5256	this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career . 
5257	i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink . 
5258	though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
5259	the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america . 
5260	no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
5261	the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset . 
5262	at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin . 
5263	never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . 
5264	the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
5265	este � apenas mais um ( longo ) epis�dio do programa da mtv . a �nica diferen�a � que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas . 
5266	technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial . 
5267	the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is . 
5268	the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
5269	while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production . 
5270	the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . 
5271	it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell . 
5272	its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
5273	any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
5274	feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network . 
5275	lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun . 
5276	credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
5277	denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony . 
5278	if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
5279	so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check . 
5280	rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . 
5281	there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent . 
5282	i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing . 
5283	an awkward and indigestible movie . 
5284	the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
5285	haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
5286	all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi . 
5287	like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
5288	there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
5289	message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
5290	no movement , no yuks , not much of anything . 
5291	'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . 
5292	thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired . 
5293	heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension . 
5294	the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
5295	a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
5296	a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
5297	the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark . 
5298	plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights . 
5299	it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
5300	quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
5301	the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
5302	what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
5303	cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
5304	looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
5305	the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end . 
5306	high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character . 
5307	the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
5308	de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
5309	i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
5310	another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
5311	with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role . 
5312	so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
5313	though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
5314	has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags . 
5315	britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
5316	" "" the kid stays in the picture "" is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . "
5317	well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
5318	sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
5319	if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna . 
5320	this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay . 
5321	just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
5322	the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
5323	enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
5324	the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
5325	a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones . 
5326	gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
5327	a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
5328	needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
5329	the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it . 
5330	madonna still can't act a lick . 
5331	even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
5332	if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
5333	the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
5334	serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . 
5335	don't let your festive spirit go this far . 
5336	though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear . 
5337	hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading . 
5338	intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area . 
5339	sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
5340	director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . 
5341	 . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
5342	suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal . 
5343	i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
5344	movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
5345	the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
5346	i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
5347	a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
5348	flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
5349	even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
5350	the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
5351	despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
5352	mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
5353	a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad . 
5354	the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama . 
5355	another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
5356	aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
5357	outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride . 
5358	much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [the movie's] mindset . 
5359	well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
5360	home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice . 
5361	[nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes . 
5362	passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings . 
5363	looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due . 
5364	truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before . 
5365	abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists . 
5366	even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge . 
5367	filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . 
5368	the movie gets muted and routine . 
5369	the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
5370	it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
5371	the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels . 
5372	it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
5373	i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness . 
5374	k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich . 
5375	a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more . 
5376	automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
5377	black-and-white and unrealistic . 
5378	the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off . 
5379	feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers . 
5380	ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue . 
5381	a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
5382	elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one . 
5383	it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . 
5384	 in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . 
5385	this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . 
5386	the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . 
5387	a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . 
5388	men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . . 
5389	a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
5390	an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living . 
5391	say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
5392	after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna . 
5393	instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
5394	two-bit potboiler . 
5395	a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid cr�me br�l�e . 
5396	maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . 
5397	never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery . 
5398	the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place . 
5399	it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 
5400	a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
5401	it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you . 
5402	this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience . 
5403	propelled not by characters but by caricatures . 
5404	there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
5405	this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
5406	earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
5407	the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . 
5408	for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . 
5409	a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
5410	if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public . 
5411	frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . 
5412	places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 
5413	stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition ? wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text ? when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
5414	a very average science fiction film . 
5415	undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters . 
5416	how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . 
5417	the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . 
5418	the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
5419	the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 
5420	ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
5421	a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
5422	those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
5423	jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips . 
5424	as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure . 
5425	static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year . 
5426	for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
5427	un thriller manqu� qui tombe sur les nerfs presque d�s la premi�re image . 
5428	when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
5429	what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
5430	while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
5431	yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
5432	preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
5433	calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
5434	none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . 
5435	 . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . 
5436	as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . 
5437	splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
5438	 . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
5439	will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . 
5440	this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
5441	at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
5442	rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation . 
5443	screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
5444	the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
5445	bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
5446	the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . 
5447	most of the action setups are incoherent . 
5448	liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
5449	 . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
5450	the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
5451	dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
5452	a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
5453	there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes . 
5454	the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie
5455	a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
5456	blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
5457	the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . 
5458	shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
5459	this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . 
5460	all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
5461	if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . 
5462	formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
5463	only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . 
5464	when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . 
5465	[two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
5466	the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
5467	the central story lacks punch . 
5468	though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
5469	this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . 
5470	succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
5471	a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
5472	what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
5473	the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
5474	" "" men in black ii , "" has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? "
5475	sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
5476	this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . 
5477	while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . 
5478	a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
5479	the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother . 
5480	the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
5481	the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
5482	a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
5483	"apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 "" black and white portable tv . "
5484	a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
5485	the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
5486	must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
5487	despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . 
5488	it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
5489	i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief . 
5490	this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
5491	kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . 
5492	while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
5493	any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
5494	i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
5495	has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
5496	it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
5497	fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
5498	a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . 
5499	a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
5500	it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original . 
5501	the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
5502	the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it . 
5503	it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
5504	maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . 
5505	a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
5506	the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
5507	based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
5508	just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
5509	to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . 
5510	national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
5511	this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
5512	ecks this one off your must-see list . 
5513	overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
5514	the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
5515	it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
5516	just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
5517	just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
5518	every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
5519	"this isn't a "" friday "" worth waiting for . "
5520	everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
5521	if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
5522	not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey . 
5523	uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
5524	herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
5525	all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone . 
5526	beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
5527	secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
5528	the film's center will not hold . 
5529	myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another . 
5530	too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
5531	a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
5532	dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
5533	its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . 
5534	as an actor , the rock is aptly named . 
5535	a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
5536	"i wish i could say "" thank god it's friday "" , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . "
5537	nothing about it fits . 
5538	as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
5539	somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
5540	the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
5541	consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
5542	the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch . 
5543	the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . 
5544	johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . 
5545	ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
5546	the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
5547	the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing . 
5548	the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
5549	once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . 
5550	there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
5551	it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . 
5552	the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 
5553	even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . 
5554	the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
5555	just a bloody mess . 
5556	creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller . 
5557	martin scorsese cria um espet�culo visual que n?o possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
5558	you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
5559	has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
5560	bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . 
5561	as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious . 
5562	george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
5563	for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . 
5564	however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
5565	extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it . 
5566	what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent . 
5567	what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
5568	 . . . too dull to enjoy . 
5569	a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
5570	here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
5571	eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
5572	a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
5573	it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old . 
5574	the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
5575	[u]nrelentingly stupid . 
5576	going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
5577	lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
5578	admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
5579	a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
5580	de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
5581	no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
5582	a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
5583	the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
5584	human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
5585	city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
5586	the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be . 
5587	what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
5588	the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
5589	drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
5590	a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
5591	the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
5592	fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
5593	it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 
5594	take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets . 
5595	it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time . 
5596	showtime is closer to slowtime . 
5597	it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
5598	the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
5599	'how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
5600	despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
5601	fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
5602	the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
5603	barely goes beyond comic book status . 
5604	it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script . 
5605	i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun . 
5606	an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality . 
5607	afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag . 
5608	painfully padded . 
5609	"maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul "" full frontal "" seems , well , contrived . "
5610	[morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism . 
5611	the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
5612	passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless . 
5613	safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye . 
5614	my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional . 
5615	too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century . 
5616	it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed . 
5617	it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner . 
5618	a sudsy cautionary tale . 
5619	a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
5620	mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
5621	leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
5622	watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . 
5623	unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
5624	on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
5625	the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team . 
5626	one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
5627	 . . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core . 
5628	murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together . 
5629	the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
5630	warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard . 
5631	[sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions . 
5632	"showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant "" if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny "" syndrome . "
5633	sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre . 
5634	don't waste your money . 
5635	though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score . 
5636	there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv . 
5637	there's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
5638	like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
5639	we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict . 
5640	you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . 
5641	chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror . 
5642	bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . 
5643	this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another . 
5644	friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ? 
5645	this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance . 
5646	i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women . 
5647	i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha . 
5648	no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
5649	a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to . 
5650	could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes . 
5651	if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
5652	reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film . 
5653	the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
5654	the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago . 
5655	despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
5656	murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous . 
5657	the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie . 
5658	that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
5659	the gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook . 
5660	the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
5661	this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times . 
5662	parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play . 
5663	flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
5664	a tv episode inflated past its natural length . 
5665	involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd . 
5666	all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
5667	anemic , pretentious . 
5668	there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering . 
5669	the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
5670	the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
5671	it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff . 
5672	suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum . punish the vehicle to adore the star . 
5673	even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad . 
5674	big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities . 
5675	usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it . 
5676	all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure . 
5677	glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism . 
5678	gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up . 
5679	an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . 
5680	without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos . 
5681	a mild , reluctant , thumbs down . 
5682	strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 
5683	schindler's list it ain't . 
5684	a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
5685	it's an awfully derivative story . 
5686	the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable na�vet� and arbitrary flashbacks . 
5687	it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable . 
5688	about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
5689	with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 . 
5690	not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed . 
5691	winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
5692	oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
5693	the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes . 
5694	the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
5695	with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
5696	"pumpkin struts about with "" courage "" pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back . "
5697	an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously . 
5698	sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth . 
5699	an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding . 
5700	half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial . 
5701	writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
5702	[newton]wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality . 
5703	unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic . 
5704	a lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable . 
5705	the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
5706	when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean . 
5707	cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke . 
5708	a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect . 
5709	'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide . 
5710	what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy . 
5711	a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level . 
5712	birot's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honor� ) isn't so much bad as it is bland . 
5713	watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
5714	enough similarities to gymkata and howie long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs . 
5715	succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
5716	christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
5717	if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins . 
5718	a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience . 
5719	like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
5720	" "" an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . "" "
5721	pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . 
5722	what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
5723	the stories here suffer from the chosen format . 
5724	while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . 
5725	just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough . 
5726	the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus . 
5727	john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie . 
5728	the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense . 
5729	hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . 
5730	build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year . 
5731	rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down . 
5732	 . . . has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor ? but it's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake- of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity . 
5733	a incompet�ncia de marcus adams como roteirista s� � superada por sua p�ssima dire�?o . 
5734	the master of disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy . 
5735	this isn't a movie ; it's a symptom . 
5736	the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly? alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
5737	the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter . 
5738	it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana's future . 
5739	a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
5740	none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor . 
5741	bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script . 
5742	even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
5743	fails to bring as much to the table . 
5744	a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick . 
5745	disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material . 
5746	if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog . 
5747	i hate this movie
5748	it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo . 
5749	gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . 
5750	at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it
5751	 . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
5752	jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company . 
5753	there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
5754	although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film . 
5755	the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course . 
5756	distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
5757	godard uses his characters -- if that's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . 
5758	the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
5759	a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
5760	eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it's only acting . 
5761	the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
5762	it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . 
5763	an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen . 
5764	once she lets her love depraved leads meet , [denis'] story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
5765	the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
5766	the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras . 
5767	what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best . 
5768	no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess . 
5769	call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message . 
5770	a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
5771	got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length . 
5772	a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . 
5773	like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
5774	i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen . 
5775	gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
5776	feels less like a change in [herzog's] personal policy than a half-hearted fluke . 
5777	one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced . 
5778	will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ? 
5779	a selection of scenes in search of a movie . 
5780	[janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
5781	will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 
5782	true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
5783	[evans is] a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie . 
5784	the script's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off . 
5785	you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
5786	evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
5787	a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
5788	loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
5789	as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
5790	limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly . 
5791	just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name . 
5792	the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
5793	while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances . 
5794	has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
5795	a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
5796	a lifetime movie about men . 
5797	the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
5798	it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
5799	this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
5800	the screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines . 
5801	i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
5802	if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
5803	this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
5804	contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
5805	i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art . 
5806	this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
5807	the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books . 
5808	whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary . 
5809	yet another weepy southern bore-athon . 
5810	i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 
5811	perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
5812	except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 
5813	this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep . 
5814	who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
5815	a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
5816	it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary . 
5817	"almost as offensive as "" freddy got fingered . "" "
5818	the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him . 
5819	it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
5820	ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film . 
5821	cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy . 
5822	for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
5823	a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
5824	reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 
5825	human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 
5826	originality is sorely lacking . 
5827	the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold . 
5828	though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation . 
5829	ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . 
5830	lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert . 
5831	for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . '
5832	there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
5833	what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . 
5834	nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
5835	i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's . 
5836	it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
5837	[i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
5838	unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
5839	just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love . 
5840	'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates . 
5841	equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
5842	excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic . 
5843	the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down . 
5844	it doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject . 
5845	this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
5846	though impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb . 
5847	cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 
5848	every note rings false . 
5849	when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 
5850	it never rises to its clever what-if concept . 
5851	admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . 
5852	this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
5853	this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people . 
5854	the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
5855	a big , loud , bang-the-drum bore . 
5856	grating and tedious . 
5857	[less a movie than] an appalling , odoriferous thing . . . so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you'll want to crawl up your own * * * in embarrassment . 
5858	the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious . it's too bad nothing else is . 
5859	hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
5860	el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors . 
5861	interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
5862	a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously , folks , it doesn't work . 
5863	there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
5864	the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
5865	i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
5866	what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
5867	[a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
5868	even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
5869	the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface . 
5870	it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
5871	i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
5872	the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
5873	the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
5874	obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 
5875	there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 
5876	it drowns in sap . 
5877	deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
5878	it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . 
5879	i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
5880	the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
5881	the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 
5882	blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
5883	uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . 
5884	director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
5885	benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
5886	the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense . 
5887	with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clich�s . 
5888	mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
5889	kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
5890	a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 
5891	the material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
5892	the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
5893	not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
5894	it's all surface psychodramatics . 
5895	the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
5896	that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout . 
5897	kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 
5898	for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 
5899	yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
5900	sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
5901	an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
5902	too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay . 
5903	there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 
5904	a wordy wisp of a comedy . 
5905	broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
5906	[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
5907	has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
5908	a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story . 
5909	ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
5910	a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
5911	the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
5912	sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
5913	i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 
5914	it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire . 
5915	some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen . 
5916	sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
5917	after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
5918	seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
5919	it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . 
5920	if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
5921	suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
5922	there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters . 
5923	seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore . 
5924	the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 
5925	as it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs . 
5926	la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , r�pidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
5927	this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
5928	if only it were , well , funnier . 
5929	its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 
5930	high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . 
5931	like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
5932	one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
5933	like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
5934	the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
5935	director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
5936	as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more . 
5937	i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay . 
5938	the picture doesn't know it's a comedy . 
5939	a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
5940	the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey . 
5941	roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion . 
5942	nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick . 
5943	lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
5944	this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned . 
5945	even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
5946	much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
5947	an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
5948	a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with . 
5949	an often unfunny romp . 
5950	a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
5951	twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
5952	it bites hard . 
5953	ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action . 
5954	we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
5955	despite hoffman's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before . 
5956	there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side . 
5957	the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down . 
5958	schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
5959	like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
5960	while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
5961	the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
5962	impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
5963	seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 
5964	the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
5965	lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
5966	there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
5967	i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down . 
5968	sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
5969	make like the title and dodge this one . 
5970	this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
5971	the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
5972	here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
5973	it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 
5974	sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end . 
5975	[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
5976	no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
5977	a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
5978	murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . 
5979	despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
5980	think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
5981	it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective . 
5982	it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance . 
5983	a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
5984	an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 
5985	the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
5986	would benigni's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ? 
5987	unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
5988	this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . 
5989	mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
5990	halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . 
5991	will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts . . . 
5992	authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 
5993	[a] mess . 
5994	control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
5995	follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
5996	the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
5997	the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
5998	has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
5999	vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
6000	 . . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
6001	a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
6002	kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
6003	kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
6004	the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
6005	a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
6006	everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
6007	a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
6008	 . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . 
6009	time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 
6010	as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
6011	eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . 
6012	to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
6013	although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ?70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
6014	a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
6015	would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility . 
6016	the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
6017	'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 
6018	be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards . 
6019	a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . in the wrong hands , i . e . peploe's , it's simply unbearable
6020	an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
6021	a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of . 
6022	dramatically lackluster . 
6023	so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
6024	"a gushy episode of "" m * a * s * h "" only this time from an asian perspective . "
6025	" "" looking for leonard "" just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . "
6026	nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
6027	definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . 
6028	good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
6029	entertaining enough , but nothing new
6030	 . . . one resurrection too many . 
6031	this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
6032	demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material . 
6033	in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
6034	no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
6035	initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama . 
6036	a timid , soggy near miss . 
6037	works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
6038	to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
6039	observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
6040	this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson . 
6041	shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan . 
6042	with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
6043	thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together . 
6044	 . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . 
6045	there's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects . 
6046	goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
6047	though harris is affecting at times , he cannot overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities . 
6048	the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice . 
6049	the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
6050	this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . 
6051	far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another . 
6052	the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . 
6053	no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
6054	i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
6055	shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story . 
6056	a negligible british comedy . 
6057	fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers . 
6058	stay away . far away . 
6059	slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you're left with a sour taste in your mouth .

6063	her film is like a beautiful food entr�e that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
6064	like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it . 
6065	no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
6066	needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
6067	in the end , there isn't much to it . 
6068	a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
6069	the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card . 
6070	anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
6071	disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances . 
6072	you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . 
6073	directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
6074	yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
6075	for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
6076	femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
6077	it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . 
6078	fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .

6082	the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
6083	these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
6084	everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
6085	o �timo esfor�o do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos s?o explicados .

6090	the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief . 
6091	director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . 
6092	strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
6093	the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion . 
6094	devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
6095	anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '

6099	plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
6100	hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
6101	the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
6102	a pretentious mess . 
6103	predictably soulless techno-tripe . 
6104	i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
6105	it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
6106	the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back . 
6107	this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
6108	no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it .

6112	lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis . 
6113	though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and clich� . 
6114	the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank . 
6115	an artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art . 
6116	the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
6117	with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
6118	barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
6119	writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results . 
6120	one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact . 
6121	in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
6122	the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .

6124	hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
6125	the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud . 
6126	it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
6127	because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
6128	it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
6129	some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema . 
6130	these characters become wearisome . 
6131	a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped . 
6132	this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar . 
6133	kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
6134	a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made . 
6135	after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
6136	contrived pastiche of caper clich�s . 
6137	many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short . 
6138	just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
6139	the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield . 
6140	like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless . 
6141	despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
6142	yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other's existence . 
6143	loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
6144	i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problem?it's supposed to be a drama . 
6145	qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating . 
6146	well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) . 
6147	donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences . 
6148	there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . 
6149	bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it . 
6150	frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for . 
6151	leaks treacle from every pore . 
6152	the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
6153	kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities . 
6154	while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
6155	blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
6156	if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright , then blood work is for you . 
6157	trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead . 
6158	the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design . 
6159	a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
6160	a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
6161	a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . 
6162	tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it . 
6163	unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
6164	a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
6165	any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors . 
6166	 . . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks . 
6167	your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
6168	like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels . 
6169	while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness . 
6170	the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that's where this film should have remained . 
6171	a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions . 
6172	a collage of clich�s and a dim echo of allusions to other films . 
6173	the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
6174	arty gay film . 
6175	jonah is only so-so . . . the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it . 
6176	an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
6177	how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ? 
6178	there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
6179	as steamy as last week's pork dumplings . 
6180	incoherence reigns . 
6181	the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 
6182	the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about . 
6183	another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures . 
6184	this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
6185	the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
6186	?its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .

6188	if disney's cinderella proved that 'a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio's wallet makes . 
6189	features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
6190	with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion . 
6191	nothing about this movie works . 
6192	if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . 
6193	a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
6194	none of birthday girl's calculated events take us by surprise . . . 
6195	are monsters born , or made ? 
6196	lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension . 
6197	the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
6198	it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making . 
6199	with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity . 
6200	less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
6201	the film is like sitting in a downtown caf� , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables . 
6202	this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor . 
6203	takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
6204	not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest . 
6205	a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable . 
6206	nearly every attempt at humor here is doa . 
6207	collapses under its own meager weight . 
6208	this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
6209	if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained . 
6210	technically and artistically inept . 
6211	those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals . 
6212	though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
6213	a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral . 
6214	call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
6215	death might be a release .

6219	a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
6220	even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . 
6221	this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 
6222	the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 
6223	written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter . 
6224	the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
6225	very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension . 
6226	like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 
6227	it's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen . 
6228	the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? '
6229	millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
6230	" "" freaky friday , "" it's not . "
6231	perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
6232	although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
6233	in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie . 
6234	maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
6235	the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
6236	this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
6237	narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
6238	somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
6239	a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship . 
6240	its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
6241	an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike . 
6242	the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
6243	a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick . 
6244	 . . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape . 
6245	it's just plain boring . 
6246	sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor . 
6247	one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time . 
6248	really dumb but occasionally really funny . 
6249	the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
6250	a half-assed film . 
6251	the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff . 
6252	while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
6253	the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
6254	they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
6255	it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man clich� atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
6256	reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
6257	if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment . 
6258	the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
6259	 . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
6260	"never does "" lilo & stitch "" reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as "" mulan "" or "" tarzan . "" "
6261	one of those so-so films that could have been much better . 
6262	crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . 
6263	fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
6264	interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
6265	cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
6266	it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
6267	it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
6268	less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice belgian waffle . 
6269	it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
6270	abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
6271	no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . 
6272	due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
6273	[t]he film is never sure to make a clear point ? even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
6274	while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often . 
6275	an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship . 
6276	nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release . 
6277	a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
6278	 . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
6279	nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
6280	"what goes on for the 110 minutes of "" panic room "" is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . "
6281	the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
6282	guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest . 
6283	schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
6284	its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare . 
6285	by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
6286	to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor . 
6287	a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
6288	pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler . 
6289	some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
6290	it's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting . 
6291	a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
6292	it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did . 
6293	sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
6294	it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors . 
6295	this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
6296	a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
6297	even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
6298	though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract . 
6299	as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
6300	sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes . 
6301	where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
6302	more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller . 
6303	the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
6304	contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
6305	return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market . 
6306	rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along . 
6307	it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 
6308	on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it . 
6309	the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder . 
6310	 . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
6311	wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . 
6312	trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens . 
6313	madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose . 
6314	never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
6315	the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 
6316	a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
6317	it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . 
6318	[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
6319	handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
6320	so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
6321	scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 
6322	russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features . 
6323	highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 
6324	very stupid and annoying . 
6325	the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
6326	a listless and desultory affair . 
6327	represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
6328	how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly . 
6329	jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
6330	wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award . 
6331	any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
6332	helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
6333	lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
6334	formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 
6335	every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
6336	apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
6337	after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go . 
6338	this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
6339	at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
6340	a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . 
6341	a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
6342	the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
6343	if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
6344	abysmally pathetic
6345	this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
6346	shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage . 
6347	plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
6348	there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
6349	it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 
6350	all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
6351	a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash . 
6352	the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children . 
6353	troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal . 
6354	at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
6355	elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
6356	it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 
6357	despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '
6358	both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
6359	does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
6360	neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
6361	just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 
6362	fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
6363	there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title . 
6364	while howard's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast . 
6365	a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
6366	go , girls , right down the reality drain . 
6367	boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
6368	can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 
6369	predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 
6370	 . . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept . 
6371	the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
6372	an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 
6373	muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
6374	too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash . 
6375	just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny . 
6376	`matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy . 
6377	at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
6378	it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
6379	wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives ! 
6380	why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ? 
6381	a grating , emaciated flick . 
6382	unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 
6383	presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency . 
6384	we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
6385	 . . . unbearably lame . 
6386	according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances . 
6387	the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
6388	ararat feels like a book report
6389	steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . 
6390	a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
6391	an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension . 
6392	the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
6393	shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
6394	with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp . 
6395	alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 
6396	the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat . 
6397	this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
6398	the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring . 
6399	much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clich� . 
6400	the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
6401	mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry . 
6402	told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
6403	the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
6404	"now i can see why people thought i was too hard on "" the mothman prophecies "" . "
6405	if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . 
6406	"with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable "" formula 51 "" is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger . "
6407	sandra bullock's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot . 
6408	a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
6409	adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
6410	this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
6411	the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
6412	de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back . 
6413	slap me , i saw this movie . 
6414	[the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
6415	behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
6416	scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle . 
6417	just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
6418	oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
6419	the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
6420	carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
6421	so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
6422	in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
6423	starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clich�s . 
6424	sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates . 
6425	one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
6426	there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 
6427	bland but harmless . 
6428	'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
6429	the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive . 
6430	resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year . 
6431	five screenwriters are credited with the clich�-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 
6432	the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break . 
6433	well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
6434	so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
6435	the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster . 
6436	la de salma es una versi�n de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ning�n contenido . 
6437	kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both . 
6438	it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
6439	"wobbly senegalese updating of "" carmen "" which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai"
6440	it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long . 
6441	ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout ? and meat loaf explodes . 
6442	bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 
6443	"the premise of "" abandon "" holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess . "
6444	what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
6445	a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films . 
6446	unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression . 
6447	the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
6448	the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it . 
6449	the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
6450	the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
6451	what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
6452	the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
6453	opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen . 
6454	despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
6455	it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
6456	the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste . 
6457	it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
6458	terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable . 
6459	as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
6460	aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
6461	a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
6462	serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst . 
6463	its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 
6464	a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on . 
6465	the story has little wit and no surprises . 
6466	the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage . 
6467	what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
6468	hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? i didn't think so . 
6469	a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
6470	dense and enigmatic . . . elusive . . . stagy and stilted
6471	[t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 
6472	the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 
6473	 . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 
6474	plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
6475	the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
6476	a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . 
6477	a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks . 
6478	just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 
6479	a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
6480	there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more . 
6481	the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life . 
6482	a quaint , romanticized rendering . 
6483	what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
6484	the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness . 
6485	a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
6486	woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them . 
6487	she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . . 
6488	not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 
6489	been there done that . 
6490	there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew . 
6491	a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 
6492	schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying . 
6493	even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
6494	only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 
6495	a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target . 
6496	[l]ame and unnecessary . 
6497	a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . 
6498	it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! 
6499	 . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
6500	you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
6501	unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs . 
6502	basically , it's pretty but dumb . 
6503	this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in . 
6504	squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare . 
6505	there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings . 
6506	reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
6507	the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
6508	co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 
6509	if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . 
6510	a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
6511	if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way . 
6512	comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
6513	what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
6514	an uninspired preachy and clich�d war film . 
6515	horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
6516	a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self? this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people . 
6517	slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 
6518	if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
6519	the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
6520	i haven't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered . 
6521	little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 
6522	rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
6523	a horrible , 99-minute stink bomb . 
6524	the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
6525	"her fans walked out muttering words like "" horrible "" and "" terrible , "" but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero . "
6526	the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
6527	sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
6528	it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding m�tier . 
6529	how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
6530	when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w . 
6531	there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
6532	the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
6533	it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
6534	the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
6535	content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
6536	the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
6537	its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 
6538	[seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
6539	it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
6540	neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
6541	if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
6542	what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
6543	the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
6544	it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
6545	boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
6546	it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
6547	has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
6548	like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
6549	something must have been lost in the translation . 
6550	becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
6551	in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
6552	chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
6553	rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical . 
6554	" "" the tuxedo "" should have been the vehicle for chan that "" the mask "" was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . "
6555	for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming . 
6556	the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
6557	what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie . 
6558	plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
6559	city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
6560	whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . 
6561	as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 
6562	there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious . 
6563	i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
6564	what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate . 
6565	doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
6566	the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea . 
6567	nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
6568	nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic . 
6569	amid the clich� and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
6570	mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
6571	no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 
6572	eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
6573	strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
6574	there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
6575	it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . 
6576	there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups . 
6577	we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 
6578	like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
6579	there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
6580	the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
6581	a dreary indulgence . 
6582	i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . 
6583	derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
6584	deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
6585	 . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
6586	brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
6587	a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact . 
6588	to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
6589	tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
6590	flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
6591	zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
6592	[a] crushing disappointment . 
6593	how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) . 
6594	nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
6595	episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight . 
6596	the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
6597	[denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
6598	wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
6599	viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
6600	overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
6601	the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
6602	in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
6603	it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
6604	an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
6605	the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
6606	writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
6607	there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
6608	a cockeyed shot all the way . 
6609	lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
6610	unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
6611	cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
6612	the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
6613	seems like someone going through the motions . 
6614	"for a film about explosions and death and spies , "" ballistic : ecks vs . sever "" seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies . "
6615	wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 
6616	impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 
6617	wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
6618	choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
6619	one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
6620	a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
6621	it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
6622	the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
6623	it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
6624	wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand . 
6625	a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
6626	each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
6627	would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
6628	one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
6629	nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
6630	enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . 
6631	it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
6632	that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
6633	what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
6634	the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
6635	in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
6636	solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
6637	stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here? . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
6638	deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered . 
6639	a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film . 
6640	aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
6641	it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
6642	for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
6643	a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
6644	a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
6645	while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
6646	it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
6647	most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . 
6648	it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
6649	" "" i blame all men for war , "" [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . "
6650	it's fitfully funny but never really takes off . 
6651	i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
6652	by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 
6653	for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . 
6654	it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
6655	if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
6656	for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
6657	 . . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school . 
6658	it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons ? a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 
6659	the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
6660	tends to plod . 
6661	a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 
6662	gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic .
