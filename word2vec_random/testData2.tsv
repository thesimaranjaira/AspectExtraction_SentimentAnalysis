1	eerily accurate depiction of depression . 
2	 . . . a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet . 
3	charming and witty , it's also somewhat clumsy . 
4	directed with purpose and finesse by england's roger mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as notting hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft . 
5	escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions . 
6	this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow . 
7	[allen] manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise . 
8	i have two words to say about reign of fire . great dragons ! 
9	by surrounding us with hyper-artificiality , haynes makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way . 
10	a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession ? one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom . 
11	superb production values & christian bale's charisma make up for a derivative plot . 
12	the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 
13	i know i shouldn't have laughed , but hey , those farts got to my inner nine-year-old . 
14	a movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well . 
15	it's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it isn't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers . 
16	more vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative , but on those terms it's inoffensive and actually rather sweet . 
17	the case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause . 
18	the actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script's bad ideas and awkwardness . 
19	diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy . 
20	captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head . 
21	there is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure . 
22	coy but exhilarating , with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes . 
23	it is a likable story , told with competence . 
24	not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again . 
25	tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme doesn't drag an audience down . 
26	a small movie with a big impact . 
27	the movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing . 
28	 i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent's complaint . 
29	like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
30	a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones . 
31	using an endearing cast , writer/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred . 
32	when a movie has stuck around for this long , you know there's something there . it's that good . 
33	smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play . 
34	forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five . 
35	japanese director shohei imamura's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime . 
36	kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , and lan yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie . 
37	while the plot follows a predictable connect-the-dots course . . . director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades . 
38	nice piece of work . 
39	katz's documentary doesn't have much panache , but with material this rich it doesn't need it . 
40	we get an image of big papa spanning history , rather than suspending it .

44	a thought-provoking picture .

46	skins has a desolate air , but eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor . 
47	a film of quiet power . 
48	more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem . 
49	an intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality . 
50	the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure . 
51	yes , mibii is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it . 
52	film can't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout . 
53	o fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing . 
54	it's still adam sandler , and it's not little nicky . and for many of us , that's good enough . 
55	here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . 
56	lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability . 
57	kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing . 
58	it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing
59	while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel . 
60	the film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun . 
61	the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
62	has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre . 
63	more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . 
64	this movie has the usual impossible stunts . . . but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 
65	mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances . . . and excellent use of music by india's popular gulzar and jagjit singh . 
66	 . . . the one thing this wild film has that other imax films don't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house . that's fun for kids of any age . 
67	writer/director david caesar ladles on the local flavour with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza .

72	kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers . 
73	all in all , a great party . 
74	a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
75	" "" brown sugar "" admirably aspires to be more than another "" best man "" clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film . "
76	[gulpilil] is a commanding screen presence , and his character's abundant humanism makes him the film's moral compass . 
77	a stylish thriller . 
78	an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work . 
79	in some ways , lagaan is quintessential bollywood . except it's much , much better . 
80	though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed . 
81	scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf . 
82	what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates . 
83	the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .

85	i'd watch these two together again in a new york minute . 
86	there's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and cq shimmers with it . 
87	a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . 
88	this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success . 
89	like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting . 
90	 . . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor . 
91	coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching . 
92	the overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries .

94	worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film . 
95	handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy . 
96	a shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait , shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown . 
97	while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem . 
98	in many ways , reminiscent of 1992's unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue . 
99	we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies . 
100	an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century . 
101	the entire cast is first-rate , especially sorvino . 
102	the cat's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich . . . 
103	this one is strictly a lightweight escapist film . 
104	this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem . 
105	"the culmination of everyone's efforts is given life when a selection appears in its final form [in "" last dance "" ] . "
106	in questioning the election process , payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box . 
107	a very charming and funny movie . 
108	this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography .

110	consummate actor barry has done excellent work here .

112	while not all that bad of a movie , it's nowhere near as good as the original . 
113	ali's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier . 
114	i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that . 
115	you can sip your vintage wines and watch your merchant ivory productions ; i'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a jerry bruckheimer flick any day of the week . 
116	may be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since town and country . 
117	a chilly , brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness .

129	there's something about a marching band that gets me where i live . 
130	cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective .

436	the music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and italy beckons us all .

447	if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story ( like , say , treasure planet ) or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , i'll take the latter every time . 
448	quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year . . . a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that isn't afraid to admit it doesn't have all the answers . 
449	in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters ? damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .

458	overall , it's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs . 
459	mais um momento inspirado de david fincher . 
460	a must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride . 
461	tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of yasujiro ozu . 
462	until ( the ) superfluous . . . epilogue that leaks suspension of disbelief like a sieve , die another day is as stimulating & heart-rate-raising as any james bond thriller . 
463	it's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true 'epic' .

478	she's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations . 
479	to those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer's 'divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that's not saying much . 
480	even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
481	a thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy .

486	a mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director's travel through 300 years of russian history .

488	a finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere . 
489	the salton sea has moments of inspired humour , though every scrap is of the darkest variety . 
490	both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes . 
491	although shot with little style , skins is heartfelt and achingly real . 
492	harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
493	upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 
494	a well-executed spy-thriller . 
495	a very pretty after-school special . it's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it . 
496	a harrowing account of a psychological breakdown . 
497	continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means .

506	 . . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay . 
507	the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her . 
508	broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary . he thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject . 
509	at its best when the guarded , resentful betty and the manipulative yet needy margot are front and center . 
510	gloriously straight from the vagina . 
511	it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
512	the film oozes craft .

1073	if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann's revolution no . 9 . 
1074	the film occasionally tries the viewer's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story .

1108	if it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for .

1113	while broomfield's film doesn't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system . 
1114	 . . . strips bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults . 
1115	laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma .

1117	a solidly entertaining little film . 
1118	it's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space . 
1119	sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now . . . and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors . 
1120	despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances . 
1121	a passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action . 
1122	though nijinsky's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature . 
1123	a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 
1124	from both a great and a terrible story , mr . nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience . 
1125	spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units . 
1126	the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny . 
1127	highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
1128	neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm . 
1129	"first and foremost . . . the reason to go see "" blue crush "" is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings . "
1130	a visionary marvel , but it's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this . 
1131	the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart . 
1132	in his latest effort , storytelling , solondz has finally made a movie that isn't just offensive -- it also happens to be good . 
1133	how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones . 
1134	i just saw this movie . . . well , it's probably not accurate to call it a movie . 
1135	what's most memorable about circuit is that it's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large . . . and small . . . with considerable aplomb . 
1136	scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar . yes , soar . 
1137	a delicious and delicately funny look at the residents of a copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life tosses at them . 
1138	" "" what really happened ? "" is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience . "
1139	soderbergh , like kubrick before him , may not touch the planet's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit . 
1140	much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of don king , sonny miller , and michael stewart . their work is fantastic . 
1141	crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half . 
1142	franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance sonny needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic . 
1143	tsai ming-liang's witty , wistful new film , what time is it there ? , is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly . 
1144	the pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of steven spielberg's schindler's list . but mr . polanski creates images even more haunting than those in mr . spielberg's 1993 classic . 
1145	steers , in his feature film debut , has created a brilliant motion picture . 
1146	a brilliant , absurd collection of vignettes that , in their own idiosyncratic way , sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium .

1148	the film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in . 
1149	old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment . 
1150	an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular . 
1151	a fun family movie that's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh , cry and realize , 'it's never too late to believe in your dreams . '
1152	if you open yourself up to mr . reggio's theory of this imagery as the movie's set . . . it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change . 
1153	i had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was earnest . 
1154	even though the film doesn't manage to hit all of its marks , it's still entertaining to watch the target practice . 
1155	where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable . 
1156	the 3-d vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry . 
1157	the attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way . 
1158	fans of the modern day hong kong action film finally have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for . 
1159	even when he's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work . 
1160	what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material .

1164	works as pretty contagious fun .

1166	a realistically terrifying movie that puts another notch in the belt of the long list of renegade-cop tales . 
1167	a charming , banter-filled comedy . . . one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface . 
1168	a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers . 
1169	serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that the road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination . 
1170	heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart . 
1171	caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness . . . but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty . 
1172	"a "" black austin powers ? "" i prefer to think of it as "" pootie tang with a budget . "" sa da tay ! "
1173	oddly , the film isn't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny . 
1174	i would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that shouldn't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable . 
1175	chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of 'ethnic cleansing . '

1178	great character interaction . 
1179	one of the funnier movies in town . 
1180	campanella's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael's evolution . 
1181	by turns very dark and very funny . 
1182	steven soderbergh doesn't remake andrei tarkovsky's solaris so much as distill it . 
1183	for more than two decades mr . nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity . 
1184	simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad . 
1185	though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film doesn't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown's life . 
1186	the philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable . 
1187	not too fancy , not too filling , not too fluffy , but definitely tasty and sweet . 
1188	quando tiros em columbine acerta o alvo ( com o perd?o do trocadilho ) , n?o h� como negar o brilhantismo da argumenta�?o de seu diretor . 
1189	director lee has a true cinematic knack , but it's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve .

1193	if s&m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it's to this film's ( and its makers' ) credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves .

1197	an engrossing story that combines psychological drama , sociological reflection , and high-octane thriller .

1212	hey , happy ! is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it's a love story as sanguine as its title .

1226	like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end .

1259	another best of the year selection . 
1260	the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . 
1261	it's a very valuable film . . . 
1262	max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve . . . as far as art is concerned , it's mission accomplished .

1326	the performances are an absolute joy . 
1327	a quasi-documentary by french filmmaker karim dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of cuban music . 
1328	grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect .

1334	provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all . 
1335	it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has . 
1336	with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 
1337	doesn't really add up to much . 
1338	it's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind . 
1339	an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
1340	a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 
1341	borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion . 
1342	it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction . 
1343	a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
1344	the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience . 
1345	sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
1346	it's like a drive-by . you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise . 
1347	everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
1348	this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big , dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . '
1349	the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 
1350	when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ? 
1351	it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
1352	this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
1353	a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
1354	too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
1355	there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
1356	as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
1357	the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
1358	distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 
1359	plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
1360	unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party . 
1361	when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
1362	just isn't as weird as it ought to be . 
1363	"a "" home alone "" film that is staged like "" rosemary's baby , "" but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . "
1364	[siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
1365	no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . 
1366	`hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere . 
1367	they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . 
1368	a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
1369	a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
1370	it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love . 
1371	"the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the "" webcast . "" "
1372	"tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , "" the sting . "" "
1373	gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clich�s . 
1374	it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
1375	anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity . 
1376	a major waste . . . generic . 
1377	the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental . 
1378	a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques . 
1379	falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
1380	never inspires more than an interested detachment . 
1381	what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
1382	despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
1383	pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
1384	they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film . 
1385	a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 
1386	two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 
1387	it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied . 
1388	these are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
1389	swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub . 
1390	claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem . 
1391	purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
1392	feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
1393	almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
1394	writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
1395	it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes . 
1396	one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album . 
1397	phoned-in business as usual . 
1398	there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . 
1399	what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else . 
1400	director-chef gabriele muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale . 
1401	tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality . 
1402	"the most horrific movie experience i've had since "" can't stop the music . "" it may as well be called "" jar-jar binks : the movie . "" it's that painful . "
1403	god is great , the movie's not . 
1404	like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
1405	when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks . 
1406	a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
1407	as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music . 
1408	plays like john le carr� with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 
1409	you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
1410	it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
1411	despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
1412	a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
1413	[crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing . 
1414	worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
1415	the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
1416	go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script . 
1417	it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
1418	tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
1419	i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
1420	the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff . 
1421	after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father clich� has been unturned . but no . 
1422	ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
1423	releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
1424	tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
1425	it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
1426	a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment . 
1427	this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
1428	bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie . 
1429	freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher . 
1430	a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
1431	though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . 
1432	aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
1433	what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 
1434	exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
1435	seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . 
1436	even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown . 
1437	the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . 
1438	whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
1439	while american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even . 
1440	 . . . a confusing drudgery . 
1441	imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
1442	most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears . 
1443	costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
1444	it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
1445	directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 
1446	turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
1447	robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
1448	high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd . 
1449	set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york . 
1450	the chocolate factory without charlie . 
1451	long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . 
1452	hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
1453	a well-crafted letdown . 
1454	a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
1455	deserving of its critical backlash and more . 
1456	boring and meandering . 
1457	neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
1458	the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) . 
1459	the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
1460	this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 
1461	it recycles every clich� about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
1462	i'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks . 
1463	may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
1464	many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
1465	it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
1466	most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
1467	if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet . 
1468	cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
1469	feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . 
1470	all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
1471	the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
1472	" . . . post-september 11 , "" the sum of all fears "" seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . "
1473	the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess . 
1474	no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
1475	godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 
1476	humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
1477	the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
1478	solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me . 
1479	more tiring than anything . 
1480	nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
1481	 . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
1482	a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
1483	isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
1484	overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 
1485	i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
1486	writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
1487	about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
1488	everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
1489	feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
1490	less than fresh . 
1491	in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
1492	the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
1493	muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . 
1494	meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . 
1495	a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
1496	a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? '
1497	director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 
1498	dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
1499	if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
1500	an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
1501	what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination . 
1502	the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
1503	this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
1504	it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie?if only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch . 
1505	dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
1506	is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ? 
1507	it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
1508	the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . 
1509	the script ? please . 
1510	staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
1511	not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 
1512	brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 
1513	plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
1514	like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
1515	the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
1516	caso voc� sinta necessidade de sair da sala antes do t�rmino da proje�?o , n?o se preocupe : ningu�m lhe enviar� penas simbolizando covardia . 
1517	displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
1518	so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
1519	an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
1520	the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . 
1521	snipes is both a snore and utter tripe . 
1522	ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
1523	chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
1524	it's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name . 
1525	rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 
1526	even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort . 
1527	rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight . 
1528	a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
1529	some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 
1530	this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
1531	apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present hollywood program . 
1532	a lame comedy . 
1533	depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
1534	a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
1535	what's next ? rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? 
1536	can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
1537	the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay . 
1538	it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
1539	upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute . 
1540	on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc . , without the latter's imagination , visual charm or texture . 
1541	i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
1542	it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
1543	after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 
1544	we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 
1545	summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this . 
1546	the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 
1547	often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? into how long is this movie ? 
1548	too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
1549	deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence . 
1550	it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
1551	epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
1552	it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
1553	a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
1554	an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
1555	demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh . 
1556	this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one . 
1557	these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 
1558	the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it . 
1559	richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold . 
1560	the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
1561	 . . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids . 
1562	a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
1563	the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 
1564	like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
1565	a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 
1566	 . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
1567	give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour . 
1568	it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
1569	a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
1570	one of the worst films of 2002 . 
1571	i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
1572	plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood . 
1573	mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 
1574	high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
1575	this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
1576	the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
1577	this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn . 
1578	an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
1579	the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
1580	instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized . 
1581	the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
1582	i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
1583	the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
1584	the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia . 
1585	adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
1586	after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be . 
1587	'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . '
1588	a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
1589	screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
1590	if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
1591	it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
1592	like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
1593	"the star who helped give a spark to "" chasing amy "" and "" changing lanes "" falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , "" the sum of all fears . "" "
1594	a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
1595	every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 
1596	snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . 
1597	"[the film's] taste for "" shock humor "" will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . "
1598	any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
1599	if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles . 
1600	hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
1601	interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring . 
1602	things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content . 
1603	it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion . 
1604	bogs down badly as we absorb jia's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 
1605	the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
1606	demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack . 
1607	the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
1608	it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
1609	it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . 
1610	ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
1611	far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
1612	[gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 
1613	full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
1614	a ragbag of cliches . 
1615	this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
1616	a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
1617	the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
1618	it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 
1619	this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
1620	short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight? tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
1621	has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
1622	what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ? 
1623	collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . 
1624	the plan to make enough into ?an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a souffl� gone wrong . 
1625	instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick . 
1626	you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
1627	an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
1628	the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
1629	the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
1630	the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
1631	no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
1632	even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser . 
1633	one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . 
1634	halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
1635	weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
1636	we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
1637	there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
1638	'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
1639	the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
1640	most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
1641	this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch . 
1642	the secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again . 
1643	smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
1644	chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
1645	every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
1646	comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 
1647	the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
1648	its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
1649	[creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
1650	the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
1651	earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
1652	a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks . 
1653	romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
1654	has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital . 
1655	an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
1656	[allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
1657	an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
1658	mildly amusing . 
1659	not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 
1660	the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it weren't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension . 
1661	watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
1662	the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters . 
1663	fairly run-of-the-mill . 
1664	merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
1665	the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is . 
1666	more a gunfest than a rock concert . 
1667	it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
1668	a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 
1669	mildly entertaining . 
1670	it's not original enough . 
1671	a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
1672	terrible . 
1673	little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games . 
1674	degenerates into hogwash . 
1675	a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
1676	julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . 
1677	an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
1678	the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
1679	 . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
1680	so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . 
1681	i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
1682	"it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its "" dead wife communicating from beyond the grave "" framework is even remotely new or interesting . "
1683	it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 
1684	all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
1685	?passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road . 
1686	although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
1687	after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clich�s , depression and bad alternative music . 
1688	no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
1689	a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
1690	with little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee . 
1691	" "" feardotcom "" has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker . "
1692	a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation . 
1693	well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy . 
1694	seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors . 
1695	formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
1696	everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
1697	a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 
1698	the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
1699	disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
1700	 coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
1701	anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . 
1702	how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [fran�ois and mich�le's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
1703	they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
1704	collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 
1705	the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . 
1706	attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
1707	obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . 
1708	the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
1709	michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
1710	ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . 
1711	potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
1712	 . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
1713	a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
1714	most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
1715	in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
1716	rather less than the sum of its underventilated p�re-fils confrontations . 
1717	mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 
1718	plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
1719	new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
1720	amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
1721	yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
1722	a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 
1723	a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
1724	whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
1725	an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 
1726	the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 
1727	the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
1728	unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
1729	each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 
1730	except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
1731	will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting . 
1732	the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung . 
1733	for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
1734	knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail . 
1735	mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 
1736	it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -? audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 
1737	holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals . 
1738	"for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words "" radical "" or "" suck "" into a sentence . "
1739	there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
1740	an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
1741	it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . 
1742	i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 
1743	dreary tale of middle-class angst
1744	for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 
1745	[jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 
1746	lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else . 
1747	like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
1748	an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
1749	[screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . 
1750	it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
1751	friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite . 
1752	its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
1753	a decidedly mixed bag . 
1754	meandering and confusing . 
1755	there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
1756	ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
1757	not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
1758	the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
1759	everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 
1760	just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
1761	sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films . 
1762	hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .

1765	bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda . 
1766	 . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
1767	frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes . 
1768	how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
1769	the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
1770	handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked souffl� . 
1771	" "" sorority boys "" was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . "
1772	a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
1773	paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . 
1774	it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
1775	an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . 
1776	often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
1777	certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
1778	elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
1779	showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 
1780	all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .

1782	"i have no problem with "" difficult "" movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . but first , you have to give the audience a reason to <b>want</b> to put for that effort , and "" i"
1783	been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
1784	what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . 
1785	sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
1786	fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers . 
1787	barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 
1788	none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens . 
1789	the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics . 
1790	'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
1791	at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
1792	the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
1793	while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
1794	a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
1795	what's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well , it's not as pathetic as the animal . 
1796	with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles . 
1797	the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum's good intentions . 
1798	what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
1799	doesn't add up to much . 
1800	has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . 
1801	with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
1802	it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
1803	loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
1804	mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
1805	a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama . 
1806	did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
1807	crummy
1808	seriously , rent the disney version . 
1809	as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . 
1810	like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it can't escape its past , and it doesn't want to . 
1811	" "" abandon "" will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . "
1812	problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 
1813	a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
1814	a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
1815	what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . 
1816	director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
1817	dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
1818	meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
1819	time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
1820	i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
1821	while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration . 
1822	i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
1823	the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
1824	whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 
1825	as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
1826	the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
1827	if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 
1828	a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
1829	may puzzle his most ardent fans . 
1830	starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
1831	we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity . 
1832	those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering . 
1833	ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
1834	the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
1835	feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 
1836	"while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out "" when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , "" it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to "" tonight . "" "
1837	an opportunity missed . 
1838	the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
1839	' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly , scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film . '
1840	more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
1841	tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
1842	[johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers . 
1843	if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one . 
1844	it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows . 
1845	any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap . 
1846	its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
1847	despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . 
1848	this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
1849	feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
1850	unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
1851	the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change . 
1852	if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
1853	welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . 
1854	makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
1855	even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . 
1856	a bad movie that happened to good actors . 
1857	wishy-washy . 
1858	boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
1859	screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 
1860	oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 
1861	that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year's worst cinematic tragedies . 
1862	it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
1863	rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
1864	if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
1865	the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
1866	the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
1867	mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
1868	shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
1869	in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
1870	[t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
1871	the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side . 
1872	what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
1873	despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
1874	director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
1875	shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling . 
1876	even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
1877	some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . 
1878	all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
1879	[a] stale retread of the '53 original . 
1880	one thing's for sure?if george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
1881	for dance completists only . 
1882	one of the worst movies of the year . 
1883	spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
1884	it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
1885	the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
1886	yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
1887	inconsequential road-and-buddy pic . 
1888	i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
1889	this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it can't really be called animation . 
1890	makes 98 minutes feel like three hours . 
1891	hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
1892	aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
1893	real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
1894	the title , alone , should scare any sane person away . 
1895	low comedy doesn't come much lower . 
1896	appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
1897	it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins . 
1898	one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once . 
1899	this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream . 
1900	let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears . 
1901	a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy . 
1902	an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
1903	insufferably naive . 
1904	the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 
1905	the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
1906	maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 
1907	a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
1908	i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
1909	ill-considered , unholy hokum . 
1910	amazingly lame . 
1911	 . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
1912	like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 
1913	one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
1914	forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
1915	the film's most improbable feat ? it didn't go straight to video . 
1916	 . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
1917	the chateau . . . is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters . 
1918	cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
1919	it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
1920	the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses ? and ours ? and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
1921	about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life . 
1922	an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
1923	we could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product . 
1924	instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
1925	whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
1926	becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
1927	family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance . 
1928	grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
1929	like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
1930	two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending . 
1931	shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . 
1932	the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
1933	i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
1934	the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
1935	a movie to forget
1936	for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
1937	enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
1938	it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
1939	the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
1940	the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
1941	van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
1942	a complete waste of time . 
1943	it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
1944	do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
1945	the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
1946	tennessee williams by way of oprah's book club . 
1947	so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie . 
1948	the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
1949	stale and clich�d to a fault . 
1950	this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
1951	watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard . 
1952	the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids . 
1953	starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 
1954	some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
1955	unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie's heart . 
1956	witless and utterly pointless . 
1957	when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
1958	show me the mugging . 
1959	represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
1960	visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying . 
1961	as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
1962	a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it . 
1963	a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
1964	"with a "" spy kids "" sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a "" snl "" has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? "
1965	it's just rather leaden and dull . 
1966	lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago . 
1967	'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo m�stico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensaci�n de inconformidad que hace pensar m�s de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '
1968	statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
1969	instead of trying to bust some blondes , [diggs] should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad . 
1970	initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
1971	de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
1972	dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
1973	there's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits . 
1974	when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
1975	the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
1976	[toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material . 
1977	adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
1978	"essentially "" fatal attraction "" remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . "
1979	even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
1980	the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
1981	a singularly off-putting romantic comedy . 
1982	this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
1983	it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
1984	in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
1985	check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
1986	a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story . 
1987	a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
1988	the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
1989	as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
1990	starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
1991	 . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
1992	director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
1993	there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
1994	its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
1995	at times , it actually hurts to watch . 
1996	nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
1997	the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . 
1998	[tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
1999	a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
2000	long before it's over , you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser . 
2001	i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
2002	hollywood's answer to an air ball . 
2003	and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> . 
2004	such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
2005	a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much . 
2006	i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
2007	like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal . 
2008	there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has- been-told-a- thousand-times- before movie . 
2009	always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
2010	this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
2011	there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
2012	one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
2013	from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
2014	yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
2015	despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
2016	there's an admirable rigor to jimmy's relentless anger , and to the script's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there's no place for this story to go but down . 
2017	once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
2018	a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures . 
2019	[a] slummer . 
2020	such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution . 
2021	[allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
2022	this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
2023	an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
2024	rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic . 
2025	a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
2026	so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
2027	a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
2028	does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
2029	this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
2030	the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
2031	"it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : "" got aids yet ? "" "
2032	in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . 
2033	the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 
2034	the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections . 
2035	a clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film . . . 
2036	[a] poorly executed comedy . 
2037	the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clich�d and too often strains credulity . 
2038	what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
2039	the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few . 
2040	a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing . 
2041	to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
2042	this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 
2043	it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
2044	scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept . 
2045	a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
2046	not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes . 
2047	there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
2048	it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
2049	the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . 
2050	sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
2051	here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better . 
2052	this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved . 
2053	fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
2054	weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes . 
2055	sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb . 
2056	presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
2057	the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill . 
2058	was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
2059	it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots . 
2060	it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
2061	you . . . get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . 
2062	'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
2063	it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
2064	the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
2065	the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
2066	i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
2067	director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times . 
2068	viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess . 
2069	a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest . 
2070	get out your pooper-scoopers . 
2071	while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
2072	it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
2073	sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its �lan , humor , bile , and irony . 
2074	more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining . 
2075	there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
2076	 . . . really horrible drek . 
2077	it's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ?em together here . 
2078	the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
2079	it's a long way from orwell's dark , intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation . 
2080	its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
2081	the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
2082	more precious than perspicacious
2083	if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
2084	[t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
2085	if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
2086	enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . 
2087	most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
2088	starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
2089	while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
2090	it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
2091	most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
2092	"perry's good and his is an interesting character , but "" serving sara "" hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . "
2093	culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
2094	memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
2095	it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good . 
2096	in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
2097	an intriguing near-miss . 
2098	the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
2099	like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party . 
2100	it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . 
2101	beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments . 
2102	snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 
2103	piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
2104	starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
2105	nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
2106	it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success . 
2107	the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
2108	a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer . 
2109	all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise . 
2110	green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . 
2111	there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
2112	the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling . 
2113	wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
2114	resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
2115	poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions . 
2116	pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . 
2117	unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
2118	a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
2119	an empty , purposeless exercise . 
2120	earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock . 
2121	haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
2122	a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
2123	those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . 
2124	a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
2125	what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes . 
2126	ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
2127	ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
2128	it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
2129	feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women . 
2130	when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . 
2131	this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 
2132	hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud . 
2133	if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
2134	a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets . 
2135	the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
2136	this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
2137	a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
2138	davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 
2139	the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made . 
2140	ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clich� of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
2141	a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
2142	tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
2143	 ( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent , but spacey's . 
2144	master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
2145	a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
2146	suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
2147	a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
2148	fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
2149	spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative . 
2150	it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
2151	this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
2152	the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that . 
2153	tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
2154	ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
2155	too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
2156	cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story . '
2157	what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
2158	a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
2159	visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay . 
2160	while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
2161	if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . 
2162	 sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
2163	allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
2164	you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
2165	the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
2166	the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving . 
2167	replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
2168	it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
2169	despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
2170	 . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
2171	attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
2172	i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
2173	it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
2174	flat , misguided comedy . 
2175	girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy . 
2176	the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
2177	the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
2178	no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
2179	unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
2180	a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
2181	bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
2182	lurid and less than lucid work . 
2183	a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women . 
2184	at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab . 
2185	if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
2186	this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
2187	this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio . 
2188	once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
2189	a porn film without the sex scenes . 
2190	the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice . 
2191	a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 
2192	return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing . 
2193	by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
2194	while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
2195	broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
2196	yes they can swim , the title is merely anne-sophie birot's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through . 
2197	don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) . 
2198	slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious . 
2199	the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
2200	in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 . 
2201	for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash . 
2202	a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
2203	this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
2204	ah , the travails of metropolitan life ! alas , another breathless movie about same ! 
2205	in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . 
2206	though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
2207	done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
2208	despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
2209	slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
2210	though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
2211	" "" one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? "" um? . . isn't that the basis for the entire plot ? "
2212	" "" not really as bad as you might think ! "" "
2213	strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
2214	one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
2215	it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
2216	its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
2217	seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . 
2218	the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
2219	i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
2220	an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
2221	ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
2222	comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man . 
2223	it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
2224	"in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the "" queen "" and less of the "" damned . "" "
2225	hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
2226	kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
2227	it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
2228	"none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with "" xxx "" is that its own action isn't very effective . "
2229	a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
2230	a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
2231	"director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the "" miami vice "" checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . "
2232	in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 
2233	the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
2234	perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
2235	according to wendigo , 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
2236	an encouraging effort from mccrudden
2237	the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
2238	if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
2239	supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
2240	adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
2241	to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
2242	a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally . 
2243	this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
2244	with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
2245	this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
2246	dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
2247	"i walked away not really know who "" they "" were , what "" they "" looked like . why "" they "" were here and what "" they "" wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . "
2248	predictably melodramatic . 
2249	after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
2250	a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . 
2251	the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . but the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
2252	adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all . 
2253	 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
2254	too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets . 
2255	it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
2256	the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you . 
2257	the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless . 
2258	despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
2259	even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test . 
2260	a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
2261	 . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
2262	the movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself . 
2263	the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
2264	disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies?or any other john woo flick for that matter . 
2265	the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
2266	'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down . 
2267	what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows . 
2268	an ugly , revolting movie . 
2269	the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
2270	the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i can't remember a single name responsible for it . 
2271	"watching "" ending "" is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . "
2272	certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
2273	it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
2274	the skills of a calculus major at m . i . t . are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ? 
2275	"from the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line , "" besotted "" is misbegotten"
2276	my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
2277	a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
2278	filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
2279	directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
2280	the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
2281	an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
2282	solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
2283	harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 
2284	supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest . 
2285	while hoffman's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
2286	the smash 'em-up , crash 'em-up , shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense . 
2287	deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
2288	hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . 
2289	theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
2290	this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
2291	novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 
2292	been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
2293	the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
2294	the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 
2295	the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
2296	forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
2297	when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
2298	such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . 
2299	burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
2300	'es en verdad una pena que mandoki est� realizando cintas tan malas desde hace alg�n tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero qui�n sabe d�nde lo tiene escondido . '
2301	while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
2302	another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
2303	too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
2304	it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
2305	the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
2306	the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much . 
2307	why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
2308	the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
2309	exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
2310	the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 
2311	all mood and no movie . 
2312	press the delete key . 
2313	simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
2314	once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 
2315	 . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
2316	there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
2317	lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
2318	this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
2319	death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again . 
2320	the threat implied in the title pok�mon 4ever is terrifying ? like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
2321	the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
2322	to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 
2323	entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
2324	the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
2325	by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
2326	at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
2327	the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
2328	never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
2329	wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway . 
2330	has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . 
2331	the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end . 
2332	mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
2333	showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
2334	a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
2335	too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
2336	fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
2337	it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 
2338	woody , what happened ? 
2339	juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
2340	it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 
2341	you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . 
2342	throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
2343	cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
2344	routine and rather silly . 
2345	a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
2346	totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
2347	you can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
2348	behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
2349	while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 
2350	lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
2351	"if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , "" rollerball "" 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j . "
2352	a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . 
2353	how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
2354	the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
2355	more trifle than triumph . 
2356	the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
2357	festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
2358	lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
2359	it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out . 
2360	rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
2361	report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
2362	the pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated . 
2363	as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
2364	 . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
2365	bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay . 
2366	a well-acted , but one-note film . 
2367	blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
2368	the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications . 
2369	[lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . 
2370	there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
2371	one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . 
2372	a era do gelo diverte , mas n?o convence . � um passatempo descompromissado ? e s� . 
2373	no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script . 
2374	it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
2375	nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
2376	the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 
2377	earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
2378	ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
2379	the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 
2380	we started to wonder if ? some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
2381	even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
2382	more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
2383	bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
2384	when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
2385	this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
2386	marinated in clich�s and mawkish dialogue . 
2387	whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title . 
2388	[a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
2389	not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
2390	rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . 
2391	the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
2392	not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
2393	shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 
2394	suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling . 
2395	violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . 
2396	nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 
2397	with a completely predictable plot , you'll swear that you've seen it all before , even if you've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
2398	remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
2399	"blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky "" pretty woman "" retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . "
2400	this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
2401	what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad . 
2402	if they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn . 
2403	a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
2404	a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
2405	where the film falters is in its tone . 
2406	the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
2407	ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 
2408	it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
2409	feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
2410	some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
2411	an enigmatic film that's too clever for its own good , it's a conundrum not worth solving . 
2412	a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
2413	rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
2414	a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . 
2415	it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
2416	definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
2417	certainly not a good movie , but it wasn't horrible either . 
2418	although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
2419	the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
2420	it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich�s the filmmakers could dredge up . 
2421	nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
2422	it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
2423	while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
2424	it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
2425	a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
2426	a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
2427	if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and clich� . 
2428	stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
2429	this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
2430	does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 
2431	`martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
2432	the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so . 
2433	never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
2434	it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
2435	does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring . 
2436	don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy . 
2437	 . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
2438	like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
2439	the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either . 
2440	competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
2441	the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
2442	not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
2443	this thing is virtually unwatchable . 
2444	those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
2445	the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows . 
2446	the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
2447	the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
2448	in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
2449	swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
2450	the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
2451	the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
2452	a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 
2453	the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
2454	spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
2455	a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
2456	the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits .

2458	an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
2459	a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . 
2460	this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often . 
2461	this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .

2469	a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
2470	gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
2471	talkiness isn't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark . 
2472	the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 
2473	the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
2474	the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
2475	charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
2476	what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
2477	no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
2478	the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
2479	 . . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful . 
2480	a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
2481	little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .

2483	this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .

2506	harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
2507	sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard . 
2508	[lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
2509	one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
2510	though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .

2522	all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
2523	the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
2524	rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the na�f's encounter with the world . 
2525	mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls .

2530	the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
2531	this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
2532	the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .

2539	some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
2540	the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
2541	i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits

2550	the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 
2551	an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .

2553	one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .

2556	[hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
2557	too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .

2559	 . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
2560	swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
2561	the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 
2562	you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
2563	diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
2564	a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
2565	an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
2566	it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
2567	absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying . 
2568	eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
2569	eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof . 
2570	no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
2571	you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
2572	'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
2573	in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
2574	blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
2575	veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda . 
2576	staggeringly dreadful romance . 
2577	movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
2578	final verdict : you've seen it all before .

2581	further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap . 
2582	you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . 
2583	the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course . 
2584	this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things . 
2585	a full-frontal attack on audience patience . 
2586	any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors . 
2587	it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
2588	"debut effort by "" project greenlight "" winner is sappy and amateurish . "
2589	one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny . 
2590	the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 
2591	the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
2592	the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
2593	purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
2594	 . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 
2595	though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
2596	well-made but mush-hearted . 
2597	humor in i spy is so anemic . 
2598	the film is strictly routine . 
2599	a real snooze . 
2600	skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
2601	while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
2602	in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
2603	it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . 
2604	the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down . 
2605	you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
2606	barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
2607	if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . 
2608	we get the comedy we settle for . 
2609	the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
2610	two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 
2611	a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . and neither do cliches , no matter how 'inside' they are . 
2612	the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
2613	its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
2614	the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork . 
2615	cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
2616	manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
2617	hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
2618	true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
2619	doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
2620	the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
2621	kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
2622	the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
2623	queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 
2624	it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
2625	any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
2626	 . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
2627	the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
2628	though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
2629	in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian . 
2630	feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
2631	no surprises . 
2632	you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 
2633	the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
2634	this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
2635	characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
2636	"the venezuelans say things like "" si , pretty much "" and "" por favor , go home "" when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of "" dragonfly . "" "
2637	it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
2638	director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
2639	it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
2640	like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
2641	as pedestrian as they come . 
2642	a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
2643	it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . 
2644	put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
2645	more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
2646	an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle . 
2647	the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . 
2648	as saccharine as it is disposable . 
2649	you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
2650	the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
2651	very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
2652	too much power , not enough puff . 
2653	the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
2654	it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 
2655	a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
2656	muddled , trashy and incompetent
2657	for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league . 
2658	narc is all menace and atmosphere . 
2659	though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
2660	despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
2661	it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
2662	his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
2663	it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
2664	a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . 
2665	there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
2666	as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . 
2667	the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
2668	enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid .
